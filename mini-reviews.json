If you look around the miniusa website you'll have a hard time finding anything relating to fuel efficiency while it was very proudly displayed among the info for the previous model.  It's a nice car, but one of the few perks it actually had was fuel efficiency. Now it's got a new engine(3 cylinder!) and the MPG is humorously bad. It gets 23 mpg in the city which is on par with some large sport utility vehicles but it's still a tiny car by comparison.  We've had three MINI's so I'm not a MINI basher. We previously had a Clubman that got 32 mpg on the same to work routes the new Clubman gets 23 mpg. What automaker does that?? In sum, you can get far more for far less money with lots of other vehicles.  The only benefits is that it looks different and you can find your car in a parking lot.  We have a ALL4 base model which is not listed among the choices here.",

                    "text": "The Clubman is about the same exterior and interior dimensions as the 3 series BMW. The S has a bit less BHP than the BMW 328, but this is almost unnoticeable and has plenty of power to spare, so don't be dissuaded by the side-by-side figures. The ALL4 provides superior traction in most conditions, which provides an additional level of confidence and safety on slick roads. Although both the BMW and the MINI have run flat tires as standard equipment, MINI offers a donut spare as an option and BMW does not. I would say that the handling of the Clubman is on an (excellent) par with the 3 series, and I actually prefer the MINI. The Clubman also has a panoramic sunroof as an option. The NAV/Entertainment architecture on the MINI is very similar to the BMW i-Drive, so transitioning from a BMW to a MINI is almost seamless. Interior comfort, in my 6' 1\" opinion, is actually superior in form, fit, and finish to the 3 series Bimmer, and the wagon design with folding rear seats of the Clubman is more practical than a sedan when you have stuff to load (BMW 3 series can be ordered as a wagon, but these are rare on BMW lots in the USA). MINI promotes and lends itself to some very nice individualizations (Stripes, wheels, etc.), so you can easily and economically modify the look of your MINI to make it uniquely \"your own,\" whereas with BMW, you more or less get what you buy/lease. Gas mileage could be better, but these cars inspire sporty driving, so my mileage may be as a result of my own lead foot and not the car. Warranties and maintenance plans are comparable between the MINI brand and the BMW (MINI is owned by BMW), and the MINI service department (at least where I live) is friendly, clean, well stocked, knowledgeable, and first rate with loaner cars available for customers. All this said, I think one of the things I like most about driving a MINI is that they aren't as ubiquitous and as cliche' as the BMW brand, and it's just a hoot to drive at about $8K+ less MSRP than a comparably equipped BMW. If you enjoy driving for the pleasure of driving and don't test drive a MINI Clubman S when considering premium compact cars, then you are shortchanging yourself.",

The answer is... AMAZING! After having a 2014 Audi Allroad, we decided that we loved the wagon body style. It's completely fits our lifestyle. We have two boys, 13 & 15. They play about every sport imaginable and we needed a vehicle that could hold up to holding all of the gear. Have a roof rack for skis? Check. Have a massive trunk for football gear, lacrosse gear, dogs, and suitcases? Check. A super swaggy vehicle to drive at the age of 36? Check. Our Clubman is the best vehicle we have owned to date and will definitely be purchasing another one for my wife. I previously drove an Audi Allroad, and although it was a super luxurious vehicle... It wasn't that fun to drive. And with the Clubman? I feel on top of the world.",

The room in the back is perfect for wine, hiking poles, cooler, 1 large suitcase and 2 back packs. My only dislike; the run flat tires. Expensive to replace  and are good for about 25-27 G's.

How is it that MINI (Read BMW) can pack so much stuff into this price point but no one else can? Bi-xenon lamps in a car with a base price of $20,000! This can not be possible. Then you drive the car, its engine is smooth with a very linear feel to the power, especially considering that it is supercharged. Then you take your favorite corner and realize that it is going to be one of the most fun cars you will ever drive. Taking that corner at great speed, I had as big a smile on my face as I did the first time I hammered on a new 911 Turbo S. The moral of the story is stop reading buy a MINI Cooper S.",

To say I have been let down with this car and BMW's backing of this car would be the understatement of the millennium! The transmission went at 42,000 miles and the wanted 7,500 to replace it, even though there were hundreds of similar complaints of faulty tranny's, BMW simply turned its head! Next were the window motors, the end caps of the rain gutters, the exhaust (at over a grand), the power steering pump, and more! This car is the biggest pile of garbage around!",

Being that our economy is so great and I can't get a job- I couldn't afford the thousands it cost to fix it.. and lost over thousands in letting it go for pennies.  I am saddened beyond belief that a car that I thought was so incredible, after all, a BMW etc., turned out to be the biggest lemon that I have ever purchased. OK..

Dealer tells me it's my driving - but I have been driving Beemer stick-shifts my whole life - I never had to have either one of those parts replaced until I got to 175,000. miles.  Furthermore, all maintenance the car needs is very expensive - which may have to do with individual dealerships. Nor am I happy about the acceleration of the car.  It certainly does not compare to any of the 3- series of the BMW's - but then again it's also cheaper.",

I can still even get four folks in for a run to the movies, mall or what have you. I love it and so far and I'm glad that I bought it. I wish I could have gotten a smarter salesperson at the Mini dealer who told me that there was no certified used program thus causing me to get one someplace else.

And when I found one that would he told me mini's have problems all the time. That the check engine lights always come on and always have oil problems. The only good thing is that it is cute and gets good gas mileage. Other then that I really have nothing good to say about this car. After mine gets out of the shop I am selling it immediately.",

Replaced front rotors/pads.  Replaced front left hub/bearing at $300 just for parts.  Within the last couple of days my windows started opening by themselves, and the doors started unlocking themselves.  When I go out in the morning, it's unnerving to see the windows open, and all the locks unlocked.  Don't\n know what's up with this.  Called dealer, and asked about oil/filter, and replace radiator hoses, and thermostat.  $365.  Seems a little high.  Anyone have info on the mysterious window/locks working by themselves?",

This car has been nothing but one major problem after another. The first year I got it I was on the highway and the car just stopped switching gears above third gear. Luckily that was covered under warranty. Since, I have had the air conditioning go out twice, the power steering go out, windows stopped, door locks stopped, numerous overheating episodes, etc. My poor father has spent numerous hours and dollars repairing this thing.

I loved the open glass top of the roof, but it seemed like it made the car so hot it would take quite a while to cool down.\nTint on the side windows might have helped that. Cups in the cup holder would block the little toggle switches, but I didn't really mind.\nApparantly the trannys are known for problems which I wish I wold have researched, as I am still in school & now have no car since I cant afford 5000 to fix that! Then when you replace the transmission how do you know you're not putting the same problematic tranny back into it? Who can afford taking that chance?",

Then the driver's side door handle quit working so I had to roll window down to get out, until window quit too, then I had to crawl out passenger side. Electrical issues caused all windows + sunroof to open when it rained which ruined the cloth seats. Then it started running out of gas before it was on E. Doors locked shut once so my bf had to crawl out window & I had go out trunk so I could roll window up. Then the tranny quit! $5k for a rebuilt!

Then, just this past week, after approximately 21 months and 9,000 more miles on the car, I had to have the clutch replaced again.   Seriously, while the car looks really cool and is sometimes fun to drive, it is *not* worth all the extra money it will cost you for ownership.

                    "text": "I had my 2003 Mini Cooper S for just over a year. It was a good year of ownership but not without it's major hiccups. I, too, was one of the people that thought I would be amongst the \"lucky ones\" and not have any of the issues that the other reviews mentioned. I wish I was wrong. The Mini was not bad at first...I got mine with only 57K miles. It was fun to drive, gripped like a go cart, had decent acceleration, and got okay fuel economy. Just over a year later I am glad it is gone (with 64K miles). I miss it, but it was far too expensive to maintain. Here is my list of the things that went wrong while I owned the car (I kept up on maintenance, or at least tried to): 1. Engine would occasionally randomly have issues idling and sometimes shut down. 2. The A/C is basically non-existent. Even with a fresh re-charge it never blew cold or strong enough to make a difference (say hello to sweaty back on hot days). Also, don't know if it was just mine, but anytime the A/C was on, even on low, the car was much harder to drive and would sometimes stall when idling. Acceleration was also drastically decreased. 3. Everything creaks and rattles from the interior plastics, cheap door sound, etc. 4. Clutch/flywheel started making screeching sounds, come to find out flywheel was burning ($1,800 for clutch and flywheel). The dealer said this is a common issue. 5. A/C compressor went out in the middle of the summer ($900). 6. Two days after the A/C went out, passenger window motor regulator failed, couldn't roll window down or all the way up. 7. Headliner was sagging since the day I got it and got worse on cold days. 8. Power steering fluid reservoir always had a leak no matter how many times it was fixed (common issue). 9. Two weeks after the A/C and window regulator went out, the power steering failed. It was a nice August summer turning around the weight of the car with no A/C or passenger window. Luckily enough that was under recall and got fixed. 10. After the recall got fixed I got a list of $3,600 worth of repairs that the dealer said \"red--required attention soon\". Add on the \"yellow--will soon require attention\" and it was up to about $5,200. I decided to part with my MINI at this point. Needless to say, it was hard to sell with such a long list of issues. If you are a college student or are tight on money, this is probably not the car for you. You can get a similar driving dynamic and performance for other cars that will not cost you as much to maintain.",

At the time \u2013 about three years ago -  the Fiat Abarth was out of stock at the local dealers and the current Mini was about an inch and a half too long. However the earlier Mini, being a little shorter, would work just fine, so I bought a used Cooper S to replace my Porsche.  The previous owner had installed 18 inch wheels which allowed the car to corner as if on rails but resulted in a really rough ride. After about a year of this, I changed to 17 inch wheels. Much better.  Any car with over 100,000 miles is going to need a lot of things replaced, and the Mini is no exception.  Maintenance cost can be greatly reduced by not using \u201cgenuine Mini\u201d parts. For example, I just had the clutch changed (for the first time) at 160,000 miles.  The dual mass flywheel used as original equipment by Mini is made by Luk in Germany. Buying the replacement genuine Luk part from Rock Auto cost me $254.79 whereas had I bought the same part with a Mini sticker on it, the price would have been $734.75.  I think of this Mini as a two person and a dog sports car that surprises many people with how fast it i",

                    "text": "Just starting from the time I got the car- I Purchased my mini last year (in 2014).  The seller did not do any maintenance to the car since he owned it (for 3 years) and no record of what was done to the car. I could tell there was something going on with the belt at the time I purchased it. (ended up being belt tensioner) \n\nWe have done tons of maintenance that was overdue along with preventative maintenance to keep it running strong.I literally drove my mini from Florida to California, then from California to Iowa, then from Iowa to Florida and had no issues. Not to mention the little car was weighted down most likely beyond its capacity as I was moving around the country a lot at the time. Here is a list of typical things that need to be replaced for higher mile minis and I highly suggest you look into these parts for replacement if you do own a mini:\n\n*Bypass valve\n*PC Valve\n*Spark plugs and wires\n*Coil Pack (usually rusted connection causing acceleration issues)\n*Map Sensors (preventative not really needed at the time)\n*Timing chain tensioner\n*ATI super charger damper crank pulley (highly suggest you go with a higher grade crank pulley- the stock ones are known to not last) \n*Power steering pump (always known to eventually go bad)\nOil pan and seal\n*replaced belt\n*fuel filter \n*Suspension bump stops\n*Engine Mounts (mine were literally done for falling apart- i went with poly mounts however it will make the car more rigid so more vibration) \n\nI am a mother with a 3-year-old son. I have a large Recaro Car seat that fits in my car. I drive my car daily and I make road trips in my car. You have to decide personally why do you want an older R53 mini? My husband and I work on our own cars so we don't pay for a mechanic; We only pay for the parts. I highly suggest Way Motor Works or ECS Tuning they have the best deals on parts from what we have found for my mini.\nThe car is small and rigid so the ride is not as smooth as our 335Xi BMW. If you want something that drives like a Cadillac then think about getting a different car. This is a fun little car that I enjoy modding and driving and I plan on replacing the engine when it comes to that point. I don't plan on ever getting rid of my mini. Is there some maintenance sure what car does not have maintenance especially once you hit 100k miles. Mini coopers are not your Toyota Camry or Honda Civic standard car they are for the unique few who find an interest in the silly character and the up and down pro and cons of what all involves the mini.",

Clutch? How's $2400? Engine? How's $6,500 on up? Automatic transmission? Don't even ask. Front brakes? $500. Broken AC? $1200 on up. New catalytic? How about $1800?   Broken sunroof glass? Again, don't ask, you'll have a heart attack.\n\nPlusses: Fun to drive, great acceleration on the S model, plenty of leg and head room for tall drivers, decent fuel economy, great handling and braking (to a point--a Mini does like to hop around a bit). \n\nMinuses:  AC sucks, punishing hard ride, jittery handling on rough roads, extremely high repair and maintenance costs. \n\nIn short, if you can't throw $150 a month at  a car to keep it running and safe, then don't buy an R53 or R52 Mini Cooper.",

Now, this is a car that was owned by the lead MINI tech at the dealership for its first 70,000 miles and maintained religiously since new. And now it has rust, yes rust on a 7 year old car. There are two big holes in the sheet metal just below the taillights. Keep in mind when buying one that you are buying a BMW product and thus comes with BMW prices for parts and service. ",

Passenger seat (can't recline) cost $600 to fix 2. Driver side door will no longer lock by itself or with key $900 to fix... yup just to make the lock go up and down. 3. power steering went out at 67k. So many people have post the same problem but Mini says no recall, cost to fix $1300 4. Pinging and clanking noise from the supercharger might be bearings. Yes I do keep up with normal maintenance cost to fix. 5. Currently at 71k car is overheating. I am hoping it is just the thermostat ",

I have had 2 wear & tear replacements that I would consider normal. New brakes put on last year (bought them from online site & had local mechanic put on for much less than dealer) and am on my 3rd set of run-flat tires, also purchased from online site. Shipped to my house and put on at mechanics shop. At 107,000 miles, several friends are in a bidding war to buy mine when I upgrade in about a year. How many cars have that kind of draw?  Everytime I think I will go back to a regular car, I drive a regular car and go running back to my MINI!",

The Mini S makes you feel like a real driver. This transmission is set-up just right to accomodate the different driving styles and situations you will encounter on the road. Comfortable and stylish interior is something I've always been serious about, after-all that's where you sit. The Mini's INTERIOR is very comfortable, especially considering how small the car is. The first thing people mention when they get in it is how roomy the interior feels. The seats feel like they belong in a much bigger car, as they're very big and comfy. Although the back-seats have been called a joke by many, they are fine for short rides and my buddies gladly hop in the back. Fold the seats down and there's plenty of space for my music amplifier and instruments. EXTERIOR - I really like the way this car looks. Every little detail makes it look great, including the double sun-roof, functional rally lights, hood-scoop, and so much more! Little things like fast heat even when it's really cold, the windshield-wiper & washing fluid system is great, it's nice to have a rear wiper with a fluid-sprayer too. Another final and big selling point is the great gas mileage you get with this car. Of course because it's supercharged it doesn't get the same mileage as the regular model but 35mpg is great for a car that drives like this! If you have been thinking about buying a Mini, now is the time to do it!",

They really covered all their bases here for what they were trying to do. Although the \"trunk\" is really small compared to a regular trunk, the fold-down seats help if you have a lot of luggage. As I try to think of ways to improve the Mini S, it becomes obvious that the BMC already thought of these things. This is a truly awesome little car and I have no complaints with it whatsoever. It is the first really cool car I've ever owned so I guess I can't compare years of having other nice cars to it, but I know a good car when I drive one, especially now that I've owned it for a while. Any shortfalls with this car are made-up for with this car's base concept of a fun, upgraded and modernized re-issue of an old classic. In many ways, this car just can't be beat if you want to have an exciting, fun, stylish, and economical car.\n",
                    "text": "This car is a blast to drive. The first thing people notice is how roomy the interior is for a car that is so small. I love the size, it is just right for me. The Mini S gives you the best of both worlds; it's speedy as heck and rides like a European sportscar but doesn't waste too much fuel. I get an average of 35mpg, but you get a lot less if you drive fast. Main things I like are the interior set-up; the dash is beautifully shaped and covered with nice material that's easy to keep clean. I like how the switches & controls are centralized around the console and steering wheel. The interior is not small compared with the outside, and it gives you that feeling of being safe that only a European car gives. When you drive the Mini, you won't feel like you're in a claustrophobic box but rather a pretty comfy sportscar! I've used it to commute 35 miles each way Monday thru Friday for the past 3 months with no complaints or problems. I found mine at a repo-auction where I got a great price on it, although it had 103K miles, it was a clean Florida car with no issues and a pretty reasonable price for me. I will be investing in a different set of wheels and tires for the winter though, as the 17-inch custom wheels & tires don't like snow at all and I can't drive in the heavy snow. I have been told by a fellow Mini owner that with the right tires and wheels, the car will deal with the snow much better.",

I have it repaired at an independent shop where I purchased the car or it would have been twice as expensive. I called the dealer to compare prices. I was able to get 286,000 mi.on my last clutch so I do know how to drive a car without abusing a clutch. This car has been a delight to own otherwise. I have been tempted to sell, but I love driving it. I keep hoping each repair is the last. Let's hope it is. I do agree each time I take it in, just to get oil changed, it cost about $1000.00.  ",

I cannot say enough amazing things about this car, but first what I learned from reviews was DON'T BUY AN AUTOMATIC. They have major problems. (I only buy stick anyways) And the \"S\" model may be faster but seems to have more issues. So I bought the good ol' regular Coop. I just bought it with 99,000 miles and it drives and rides like it's brand new! It's it so fun to drive, ever night after I get off work I find myself aimlessly driving around because it's so fun to drive. The big mph gauge in the middle is awesome, and everything has a round and sophisticated feel to it. The clutch is so smooth. It handles like a dream. The seats HUG my back, even my dad was really impressed with the car. (And he's owned over 50 cars) He owns a Mercedes convertible which is fun to drive, but I have to say I enjoy driving this more! The second I test drove it I knew that was it. The car just feels like one with you. I will keep this car going for as long as possible unless I get a newer one. You are missing out if you don't have one! Just do the maintenance yourself and you'll be fine.",

I did my research beforehand, learned cvt transmissions and standard automatic transmissions have major problems, but standard manual is fine. Also the supercharged have water pump and cooling system issues, they do have 60 more horsepower (but only .2 sec faster than base, wth?) Repair cost are about the same as any other car, just dont take it to the dealer! But DO stay on top of maintenence. Go for the base manual, you won't be disappointed!",

Then I found an 04 with 50K miles for half that and thought it would be a good way to see if we really wanted one.  This car has exceeded every expectation we had for fun, economy and attention-getting.  We occasionally read about CVT issues for this year, but after 6 months of daily commutes of 70 miles we still love this reliable, trouble-free sports car.  Just put snow tires on for our winter commuting.  My wife thinks it is a sensible choice for a mid-life crisis vehicle, and nothing we have ever owned is this much fun to drive!",

It is a tight ride in the seats, so it's not the funnest to drive for long periods of time. NOW! The downfall.  Mini cooper has had problems with the junk transmissions they put into the coopers. Despite being built by BMW, it is not a BMW tranny in the car.  My car has 67000 mile on it and the transmission is acting up in it, the cost to fix it? Try $6000, since mini does not sell parts to fix the bad trannies. Other than that, it's a very cool car to drive until you get to high miles on the car and it will cost you.",

The Carfax report looked good and there were no issues with it. I bought it with 75,000 miles on it, and within the past year, I have put thousands into fixing things. My tachometer stopped work, my break lights would stay on when the car was off, I had to replace the alternator, the pulley system, serpentine belt, and alternator clip. Luckily, the dealer I bought it from is a family owned and willing to help anyone out, and took it right off my hands this past weekend. I would never buy a used Mini again, because all of the problems came out of nowhere, and my Local Mini Dealership did not have any clue how to fix most of the problems. After replacing the body control module, my tach still does not work, and when it is dark out, I can't see how fast I am going as the lighting is out. Luckily I only have a couple of days left with my ex-dream car. LESSON LEARNED!!",

It redlines at over 6,000 rpm and the engine runs and runs. I have logged 20,000 miles on it so far this year. A glutton for performance, I've ordered an '06 \"S\", with DSC, limited-slip, chrono, cold weather, and premium pack #1. As a side note, I rented one with an automatic and took it to Death Valley and the Mojave. I drove it VERY hard and actually beat-on it over 50 miles down the West Side Rd.

Goes from 0 to 60 in seconds (my favorite part!), and can park in tiny spots (amazingly), and the seat warmers in MN should be standard!  UNFORTUNATELY-- There are no upgrades for the GPS, so I use it only as a live map.  The one cup holder snapped off the first year, so I bought a console with 2 cup holders, that sits on the passenger seat when I'm alone.  (There is a center cup holder for the backseat, which I use, inconveniently; and an ashtray I removed, but it's too tiny to be of much use).  Back seat is way too cramped for adults or children over 54\" tall, but folds flat for plenty of cargo space.  And I'm heartbroken that the trade in value is only $4000.",

Around 60K the engine mounts and bushings ($700) had to be replaced and then around 100K the oxygen sensor went out with some other parts around it. MINI refused to pay even though it was a known issue ($900 we paid) Later, Clutch 114K ($1700), 114k Cylinder #1 died on the freeway ($2700.)

The transmission, though is a different story. But there is so little body lean, it corners perfectly, why get an S model if this is enough? The rear seat is surprisingly roomy for a car this small. Most controls are simple to use. The outside is just adorable. The white goes perfectly with the black roof. Driving lamps help at night. It's sad that there isn't enough room for us and our luggage, so we can't go to Chicago with it. But it's so much fun just to drive through the city. It's so playful.",

Mine is a decked out Mini Cooper S convertible with all the options and JCW package (except the nav system). Quick & nimble but harsh and jolting ride (17\" run flats + stiff suspension = good looks+performance but uncomfortable) While no match for a hardcore RWD sports car, it has a very good vehicle dynamics characteristics for a FWD. Neutral steer with a hint of tail-out oversteering when pushed. Overly intrusive ESP (but you can turn it off). Not recommended if this is going to be your one and only car.

I nearly had 3 or 4 collisions right after I first took delivery, and, as a school bus driver, I was already accustomed to relying on side mirrors. I also dislike how the doors are difficult to find a point where they want to stay open.",
                    "text": "I love my Mini. I have the Chile Red convertible with white stripes and the car seems to glow. Mine is powered by the JCW engine kit which adds considerable lower end power to the handling equation, and while I've grown a little jaded with the 207 HP power plant, the Mini is an absolute joy to drive. It's quick to accelerate and the precise steering engenders total confidence in the Mini's predictability. All this and the Mini is soooo stylish. I live in Montana and I'm accorded near rock-star adulation while on the road or even when it's parked. While the car is a great social icebreaker, all the attention is almost embarrassing. People of all ages simply love this car!",

It is easy to use, but gets white marks on it when raising and lowering. The car has been recalled for this problem. It still does it after the fix. It looks like it can cause early wear.

It is a poor man's Porsche (I've owned a couple of Turbo Porsches in my time), with excellent tracking, braking and performance.  Its ride is on the stiff side, due to its extra springs and run-flat tires, but perfectly acceptable because of its performance.  It is happiest at 70+ on the Interstate, but does just fine around town.  The mileage is almost always in the 30's, but bear in mind that it prefers premium fuel.  If I were buying today, I'd add a Sirius radio (for station variety) and navigation, but I would not change much else.  I have just under 79,000 miles showing, and I'll drive it well over 100,000 if I'm still around.",

I much prefer the clutch feel to the lighter 2007+ turbo S cars in addition to the sound although the 2007+ models are quieter, ride better and get better mileage.",

After 1 1/2 years, and about 12K miles I started having all sorts of electrical problems. Ive had more sensors go off than I knew were in the car! Airbag sensor, Gas sensor..and a few more that I don't remember the name for. I have now been in and out of the dealership every month for the last 5 months and i'm really disappointed that my Mini cooper did not live up to my expectations. I was hoping for it to be around for a while, now I'm looking to let it go before the warranty is up. ",

The mini emblem on the steering wheel popped off when I pressed the horn. The windows and sunroof sometimes open when I unlock the car using the electronic fob. Now, the battery suddenly up and died in the middle of the day. I ran into a store for 15 mintues, came out and it was dead. Got jumped but the car died again the next day.

I don't drive very much so I only have about 3,500 miles on it so far. At first, the gas mileage seemed low, but now that everything is broken in it's great. I average over 40 mpg on the highway and about 30 or so combined city/hwy. I am also fairly small so I am quite comfortable. The handling is great. Even though it's \"only\" a base Cooper I still have plenty of passing power and zip when I need it. It's really a great little car. This car is easy to drive, easy to park. ",

Saved money and don't need the extra horsepower, extra complexity of the turbo now mileage loss from being assertive with the gas pedal. Got the chrome exterior do-dads to cheer it up, leather bolstered seats, AC, manual transmission, more chrome do-dads inside and heated seats. Must get the heated seats.

It does not get the great gas mileage I expected.  I only get about 25 mpg.  For it's size, and engine, I expected better.",

It drives like a dream, hugs the road tightly, even without the Dynamic Stability Control or the Sport Suspension.  The Harmon Kardon stereo is so good that you can hear piano jazz at 65 miles an hour with the top down. Power windows and top are standard, I believe, as are remote door and trunk locks. In fact, you can put the top down with the remote!  The warranty covers all service for 3 years. And the \"Ultimate\" plan covers tire and windshield damage as well.  The only drawbacks are backseat leg room and a tiny trunk. But if you're hung up on those things, buy a minivan!",

I have been a diy mechanic for many many years. This is not your average car to maintain. This was a super clean car when I bought it and traded it in. I had this for a year 58,000 miles to 66,000. I did the following things to the car. Tires - Most of these cars require run flat tires, because there is no spare! This will cost you more. O2 Sensors if you do not know what this is DO NOT BUY THIS CAR! 2 of them and 80.00 a pop. Brakes 140.00, Water outlet gasket just the gasket if you can find it 16.00. Plug wire and plugs 120.00. I was a fool for buying this fun car and even dumber to put money into it. What they don't tell you is the added expense if you do not run premium gas. You will eat O2 sensors up all the time. Clutch\n\n1. Don't loose the keys this will be spendy\n2. Repairs - You better have money a clutch is upwards of 1800.00\n3. Only a mini dealer can clear some of the codes this will cost you.\n4. If you have snow beware the car might be able to do it but take a look under the car there is a cooling fan that sucks up from the bottom of the car to cool the engine. Snow will ice up and bam ur back at that mini dealer again.\n\nThere are so many things im sure I have forgotten. This was not the car for me or my family. She was a ton of fun but not that much fun had it up to 140 and was scared. Took corners at 60 and wow was cool. Then I realized mmmmm im Married and 42 years old.\n\nSo I leave it up to you. They say this was the most dependable year to have. Stay away from automatics just read the blogs. Took this car on a 1600 mile round trip and that was enough for me to get rid of it. Tale care!",

Had to buy a bra for it as the front attracts all rocks. I am 65 and feel like a kid again! Holds resale value well but Mini dealers are few and far away and costly.

Love driving the car. It's almost as fun to drive as a Porsche 911 I had. Supercharged engine has plenty of power. Handling is very good, although ride is more unforgiving than the Porsche due to the run flat tires. If you don't know, minis don't come with a spare tire, thus the run flats. Repairs that I had to deal with include a leak around the thermostat (twice), a leaky hydraulic motor mount, a minor oil leak, and a faulty passenger airbag sensor that required replacing the passenger seat cover ($1200, but covered by warranty).",

My JCW is rated at about 40 more hp than the S, but you really don't notice the difference in power unless you rev it hard.  The noticeable difference w/ the JCW is in the limited slip differential, the aero body kit, and the brakes.  Cornering versus the standard S is night-and-day difference.

This time it was the computer. 6 months later the same thing, this time they said it was just a fluke, everythings fine. Again 2 more times in the past 5 months.

Knowing this you can expect expensive repairs, expensive parts, electrical issues and more...if you don't take care of it. A Mini Cooper, while accessible to everyone, is very much a sports car and souls be treated and maintained as such. I bought mine used and while I love it, I poured a good amount of money into it on repairs because the previous owner didn't take care to buy original parts, perform regular oil changes, or just maintenance in general. It's a very fun car but just be sure to take great care of it.",

However, after a few dates you start to realize that your wallet has run dry because the relationship is so expensive! Dinners at 5 star restaurants, fancy vacations, frequent shopping days, expensive gifts... you get the picture.\n\nMoral of the story, DO NOT buy this car unless you want to pay thousands of dollars in repairs. \n\nIt is cheaply made however the parts are expensive, oil changes are expensive and hard to find ($80+ per change), repairs are expensive, and finding mechanics to work on it is very difficult. I bought this used and gorgeous, with only 70k, but within a year after purchase the power steering failed ($1000), the coolant reservoir cracked open ($500), the engine mounts broke ($1000), numerous leaks and other engine problems ($5000), electrical units failed and now it thinks the trunk is always open and the tires are always low. I cannot WAIT to BREAK UP with this car! Looks aren't everything and I need a car that I can trust.\n\nAgain, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS CAR unless you're willing to throw money at it year after year.",

After all is said and done, the MINI was a great car to drive. Even the convertible is faster than most cars on the road. It's easy to play leap frog in traffic with this little go-kart. Too bad they went to turbo, because hearing the whine of the supercharger was very comforting. I will miss the MINI, but not its potential for high maintenance costs and the small cargo area. ",

However, I now commute 70 miles per day over rougher surface highways and the road noise is very significant. It makes it hard to talk on the phone, and in a quiet car (no music) it's just annoying. Reliability has been good, but the minor things that have come up required a 2 hour drive to pick up the car. The whole experience has been great, but it's time to move on. I pick up my Infinity G37 this afternoon. But I'll really miss my Mini.",

It handles as well as anything I've ever driven in the twisty hills we have here and I've driven about every sports car out there. However, at speed on interstate( say 80-90 mph) it gets squirrely. Primarily as a result of torque steer, tight steering and fact it's a square box.I've put 7k on it and have had no maintenance issues except radio. Top is wonderful and surprisingly quiet but you're blind in rear quarterpanels when it's up. Mileage has been so so (24 cty-26 hwy) but pedal has been to floor since I've had it.I'd buy another in a heartbeat.   ",

Be sure that you have support in your area in the form of a dealership or a garage that is known for working on Minis. (It is very difficult to find an independent garage that excels on Mini service and maintenance.)  Sell the car before the warranty ends.  If you keep it after the warranty expires, be ready to pay $1000 and up for each repair, and there will be numerous repairs, for example, the water pump (replaced 2x), thermostat housing, oil pan seal (replaced 2x), moonroof repairs, rear door latch (replaced 2x), cylinders misfiring, oil leaks, axle seal replacement, etc.)\n\nI loved how the Mini Cooper looked and drove.  The handling, especially around corners, was amazing.  This car was truly enjoyable to drive.  For the size of the car, it had a lot more cargo space than expected.  I used the Mini for trips to warehouse stores like Sam's Club and Costco.  \n\nI loathe the car, however, because of the cost to maintain and the frequency that it was in the shop being repaired.  This car is not reliable or practical in terms of cost and upkeep.  Due to the overall cost to purchase and maintain, I will never buy another Mini again.",

There's just something about the materials used in the interior that's a bit cheaper and I notice that there's a lot of squeaking (like of plastic) as the car shakes from movement on the road. It seems to be worse in the heat.",

It handles well, it's fun to drive, it's good-looking, and it does everything I need it to do. It fits into smaller parking spaces (a very nice perk in a city like Los Angeles). Overall great car and I can't recommend it enough. The thing to bear in mind about my feedback: my prior car was a 1988 Jeep Cherokee, so VERY different. And if you're thinking of transitioning from a bigger car to this car, be aware that you'll use your horn a little more, because sometimes people just don't see the car when changing lanes.",

Sadly, I will not be buying another vehicle from Mini.\nAlso, there is no temperature gauge, so the only possible way to tell if the car is overheating is if the area around your feet/pedals gets abnormally warm.\nThere's also a surprising kick that lunges the car forward upon breaking at red lights, stop signs, etc. It's sporadic, but it has almost lunged me into a few cars.",

However, around 50,000 miles the car's reliability took a turn. This year it was in for service 7 times, towed twice. Everything from steering wheel locks to o2 sensors has needed to be replaced. It has started to overheat, and make discontenting sounds. Alignment pins have started rattling (not covered in warranty - $700 to fix). After a recent service trip the service light was at 10,000 miles and two weeks later its at 7,000 - no possible way I drove 3k in two weeks. \nMy mom and sister both have brand new minis and love them, so perhaps this is a car not to be bought used.",

The little thing travels really well and seems the longer you are in the seats the better they get. I do wish they had put an opaque screen on the sunroof as the Virginia summers get boiling hot, but the auto down windows on the remote helps that some.

The cost and reliability will trump the fun after the warranty expires.\n\nIf you live in CT or state similar to CT (climate and roads), if the vehicle will be your sole / primary car, if you want to own it for more than three years, then I would recommend against a Mini Cooper.  Based on friends, colleagues, and me, you should research and listen to others who have lived the experience.  Your pockets and frustrations will be felt more than the fun in driving it.  Headquarters and dealerships do not take ownership of their brand, even when 200,000 of their vehicles have the same issues.  Do the deep research and you will find the consistent issues with this brand.\n\nBased on articles and other owner's experience, the above continues to be an issue.  Mini ranks at the bottom of reliability; however, at the top for repair cost through a life of a vehicle.",

I knew from experience that Mini dealership would say it was something I did so I traded it in. They never covered anything - ever - it was always my fault. I spent over 2,000 bucks on it in a year.

In all I've dumped $2300 into it since I got it a year ago. Thankfully I bought a warranty, doesn't cover everything though. On top of this, it has a very harsh suspension w/ the 17\" rims, it's pretty noisy inside, it consumes way too much oil, everything for it is expensive, and it's entirely a pain to own. Not happy.",

                    "text": "This is the worse car I've ever had!  A MINI Cooper Convertible 2007 standard version and  I was so excited when I first purchased this car. I felt like a celebrity because kids would run up to it and hug it.  I just loved the way the wind felt against my hair as I drove with the top down. We all know this car kills you with cuteness. Don't be blinded by its adorable exterior its super sensitive money eating machine. The first year the dash board was lit up with issues. The first two years I drove a loaner and Mini Cooper employees knew my face very well and I should of moved right in.\n Anyway this car has steering wheel issues that will cost you thousands of dollars to fix it. An airbag recall that Mini will repair but leave you to any other airbag related issue ( dashboard lighting ) that's probably related to the stupid recall but they want you to pay for it. I had plugin problems with the cooling system what ever that means.. The car would be shut off and it would sound like its still on trying to cool off.\nOne issues that drove me crazy was you cant bring this car to any mechanic because this is a foreign car they have no clue what to do with your car. I've had mechanics break parts on the car doing a simple oil change or changing the brake light( broke trunk light by leaning on it during a repair) so I was a slave to MINI cooper. I couldn't take it anywhere else which is super annoying. MINI isn't trustworthy either though. I went in and asked them to check my engine because the light was one. I specifically asked them to check my fluids. They didn't and later my car over heated and was smoking everywhere. They came and served it but I was a scared mess after the experience. They apologize but constantly repeat the same screw-ups due to lack of communication with the mechanics and service reps.\n Overall I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone and if you want to spend money on two cars to keep one cute one go ahead.. I drove around anxious all the time worrying about what light will come on next and how many thousands of dollars will cost me when the next light comes on. Not away to live",

I'll have to wait and see if this car can outperform the Toyotas I have owned in the past.

Borla exhaust is a little loud on extended trips. A few body fit problems noted and as yet dealer has not been able to fix. A couple of quality issues that you would not expect on a BMW product. One of the key remotes did not work-had to be replaced by dealer. Line to boost gauge pulled loose triggering all kinds of engine warnings. The car is fully loaded with all options so lots of fun things to play with. Performance and looks are real highpoints.  Electric top has a few quirks but generally works very well.

                    "text": "BMW seems determined to make Mini owners tethered to their Mini dealership service departments. There are no instructions for owner maintainence and the instructions for resetting the stupid computer for things as simple as inflating the tires are either incomplete or unintelligible. Oil change intervals of 15,000 miles are too long and only contribute to more trips to the dealer in the long run as the engine wears out. Every Mini owner can attest to the utter worthlessness of the run flat tires. Harsh ride and expensive to replace I put conventional radials on and it made big improvement. For a \"sports\" car with all the electronics I\"d expect and oil pressure gauge and a temperature gauge at the minimum, but apparently BMW engineers knew better. I bought my Cooper S with 13,000 miles and never got the Email regarding the recall for timing belt tensioner replacement until mine imploded at 30,000 miles. The local dealer was willing to replace mine, but up until that moment I'd never had oil consumption problems. Since then it burned through 2 qts. in 5000 miles. Coincidence? I think the fragments from the tensioner ruined the internal parts of the engine. The driving experience is indeed exhilarating, but beware the dealer cost for service can offset the fun factor real quick. I will not buy another Mini or any other BMW product or recommend them to anyone else. Run the other way",

The little turbo simply just eats things up and you will be in the \"repair\" tunnel of hell once things go south. And they will sooner then later.

I bought it new and it was a fun car to drive.\nIt had lots of leg room for my 6' 4\" body, but in terms of maintainability it was the worst car that I have ever owned. After 36,000 miles, I was continually plagued with either a \"CHECK ENGINE\" or \"SERVICE\" light and as a result I was forced to bring it to the dealer/car repair shop to get it analyzed. Furthermore, it had \"run flat\" tires...a terrible experience!\nTo summarize my MINI experience:\nafter 50,000 miles it turned into a lemon. To the future owner...stock up on SYN 5W-30 motor oil...you're going to need it! ",

It's no one big thing, but a bunch of little things.  Windows don't work properly, engine indication lights come on randomly, I needed a new valve cover gasket at 28,000 km and since getting the car back from the dealer, it sounds like a diesel.  I tried to get it back in right away, but was told that I have to wait three weeks, likely causing further damage.  I don't care if the repairs are fixed under warranty.  It's the hassle of taking time from my day and having to continuously take the car in that is driving me nuts.",

At that point, it was in shop x 3 weeks, they needed to get a modified \"snorkle\" part for the manifold.  There was water in there.  I thought doesn't it get cold in Europe..well yeh!  The car come May and June wasn't any better.  The car was at the dealer on ave. 1x every 6-8 weeks with less than 20000mi.  I lost a ton of money when I traded in my completely unreliable MINI contrary to what the dealer says it does lose value!  ",

Also, I'm a little afraid to take it on long trips b/c I always seem to come back needing a new tire.  Yeah, I do get lots of compliments like \"You're car looks like it's smiling at you!\" Or, \"you've got a cutie!\" That's nice, but I'm seriously thinking of trading it for a RAV 4-- more room, better tires, more comfortable on long trips.",

If it wasn't so fun to drive, I would hate it- if that makes any sense at all!\nNoisy on highway, base engine strains when pushed. Automatic trans is clunky on downshifts and has trouble making decisions. This car had some type of solenoid problem before I bought it and found that out later. Very finicky about fuel- Mini will almost spit out anything less than 93 octane. Carbon buildup problems exist and on such a tightly built engine, that becomes worrisome. The Mini, for me, is like someone that you just date but wouldn't marry.",

Each time the dealer would help me resolve the issue, but as this wasn't scheduled maintenance, I had to arrange alternative transportation.  In addition we live about an hour from the dealer so it was two hours of driving with my wife following me.  This wouldn't have been such a big deal if it wasn't in the shop at least once a month.  Moritz would not work with me, and I finally sold the car for a much more reliable Nissan.",

Getting 44mpg+ on the Hwy with a light foot in 6th gear. Styling is one of a kind.  Base Cooper still nicely equipped without a lot of added options. Interior fit and finish is impressive. Ride is a bit firm, but still in a fun kind of way, although this can get tiring on long drives I must admit. Watch the road dips as this car sits low to the ground.",

I have been getting incredible gas mileage on regular grade gasoline, 40 in town, 47 highway.  The car handles like a dream and one cannot omit the \"fun\" factor to drive one. I have 16\" run on flat tires, so the ride is a little bumpy at times, but for what it is, I consider it plenty comfortable. Nice leg room (I am 6'0\" and still must move the seat up some) for the driver and passenger.  Leg room for backseat passengers is questionable.  My wife liked mine so much, she bought an \"S\" model with automatic.  Recommend sport suspension and seats, with stereo upgrade.  ",

I have always liked Minis, and this car fit my personality to a 'T' (or so I thought).  All was well, for about a month.  I took it to the shop after I bought it to have them look over an issue I was having with brakes squeaking.  I need new front brakes; also, there were about $3000 worth of repairs that my car needed because I had holes in my oil line, and all other types of issues.  This took me two trips to the dealership to get all of these taken care of.  We will consider those my fault for buying a lemon, without taking it to the dealership before buying it.  With those repairs out of the way, over the next two years I have taken my Mini to the dealership over a dozen times.  I have had the wiring fixed, I have had a new throttle body installed, I have had to have the entire front end realigned and fixed because rain was just coming right into my convertible top, and had this weird possession episode where my tachometer was telling the rest of my lights and functions to freak out and come on at random.  I breaks down at random, and then will work for a couple of weeks, only for the issue to come up again, or another one to rear its ugly head.  I purchased my car in Jan 2014, it is now Sep 2016, I have paid for my car more than twice now!!!!!  Don't walk, run, run far far far away from this car.  The times it does work, I love it, it is so fun to drive.  But, if you are the type of person that wants to know if you are going to make if from point A to B...ever, don't buy it.",

Like the description on the page before says, \" like a go kart for adults\", NAILED IT!  The car is absolutely a blast to drive yeah ok for the first split second there's a tttiiinnnyyy bit of lag(maybe til like 1200-1500 rpms) but after it pulls harder and harder, also noise complaints??? The only noise i heard was the great roar of this four cylinder turbo screaming down the road as if it were warning the other cars to get out of my way!!! This car has GREAT POTENTIAL compared to any other cars, whether price range or in its class!  Lastly as for those who complained about the \"stiff ride\", one question for you?, Have you ever rode in a car with performance suspension before???, yeah its supposed to be stiffer for handling purposes!!!  So quit being a stiff yourself and just drive the darn thing like its meant to be driven!!!  Moreover this might be a \"mini car\" but its a GIANT KILLER that i feel has fulfilled GIANT aspirations!!!  GREAT CAR!!! (In my own opine the only thing that would make this car better would be a blow off to hear that ppssshhh, to give the car a bit more attitude like pppsssshhhhh please get out of my way!!!)",

For traveling fast and light, whether commuting or having fun, you can't beat it. Leather, stereo, ergonomics are excellent (I'm 6'3\"). Automatic climate control works well and doesn't bog the engine at all.

I have had to go back 4 or 5 times before something gets fixed. They have even lied, actually fixed something and said on the repair sheet that there was nothing was wrong.

The repairs have involved mechanical and electronic defects. Perhaps this model is defective, but the car is utterly unreliable. And if you don't live near a dealership, forget about this car.

The new MINI retains some British charm but really should be regarded as the smallest member of the BMW lineup -- it looks and feels incredibly solid for a small convertible. My wife says she feels like she's behind the wheel of a baby tank.  Our \"S\" cabrio w A/T is returning 31 MPG in mixed city/hwy driving to date. What a combination of power and fuel economy -- way to go BMW/Peugeot!  Way, way bigger inside than it looks from the outside -- I'm 6'2\" 200 lbs and very comfortable in drivers seat. Trunk is tiny, but useful w/back seats folded down.",

Maintenance cost are through the roof, parts and labor extremely expensive.  BMW sold the car with a long term KNOWN engineering defect (poor timing chain design) that has motors blowing up all over the world (ck the internet) at between 55k & 65k miles.  While maintained to absolute factory standards, mine blew up at less than 30 mph with 60k.  After fighting with the company for over 9 months (while I made car & insurance payments and had to acquire an additional vehicle) they only agreed to pay for the $11,000.00+ repairs after I recorded a series of conversations which proved I'd repeatedly been lied to and my attorney told them \"fix it today or we file tomorrow!\"  The local dealership was super but BMW calls the shots.  Although they finally did agree that it was a design issue in the end they refused to reimburse me for the towing and miscellaneous out of pocket cost which had been promised to me in every single conversation.  BMW Corporation, in my humble opinion, is run by a bunch of crooks who sell cars with known defects and should be jailed.  I will NEVER purchase nor recommend any BMW product.  Also ask about the engine having to be completely torn down and shot sprayed with crushed walnut shells as part of regular maintenance cleaning because it is so poorly designed.   I lost thousands of dollars on this car.  They're cute and fun but don't walk....RUN AWAY FROM THIS LEMON!!!!!!",

To prevent the carbon build up, I was told to use a gas additive every month and drive in a spirited manner every so often.\n\nWith my MINI S, I often find myself driving in a spirited manner. The horsepower is great for merging onto an interstate or passing slower cars on single-lane roads. It's also great for weaving in and out of rush-hour traffic.\n\nThe main drawback is the rough ride. I've hit potholes (and a ladder once) that have slammed my teeth together. However, the only damage done to the MINI was a broken headlight!",

Yes folks, this can happen to your \"fun loving\" MINI too - and probably will.  4 trips to MINI - 2 times with the engine light on and guess what?  Carbon deposits aka \"engine buildup\".  This issues starts to occur between 30- 40K.  You will notice skipping in 1st gear, decreased performance, oddities, etc... and the run around from MINI.  Good luck!

                    "text": "PLAIN AND SIMPLE-- JUST DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE !!!Bought it at Car Max in Whitemarsh, Md. 11/23/2014. Knowing it was a BMW product , and major repairs would be costly, we purchased the extended Warranty package for $4,600. And, we are so glad we did that! From 11/23/2014-10/16/2015 our 2009 Mini was back to Car Max for repairs 5 different times (variable inlet control valve; thermostat housing unit; $1,700 for the radio which controls half the instrumentation on the dashboard). Fortunately, all were covered by the extended Warranty, except the $150 deductible we had to pay out each time. Most recently, 12/23/16, check engine light on again. Stalling out problems & loss of heat from the heater. This time we took it to a Mini dealer in Towson, Md. They were open Xmas eve!! so we dropped it off & got a loaner vehicle. They just called us this morning, 12/28/16 with the diagnosis: Bad timing chain; excentric shaft; valve cover & cracked front strut mounts!! Total cost= $4,946.97. Extended Warranty is paying $4,676.97. We have owned this car for just 25 months; driven 21,000 miles; had the oil changed 4 times & it's been for major service repairs now 6 times !!!   So, if you just have to have a Mini, and you buy a used one, just bite the bullet & purchase the extended Warranty--NOT an Extended Service Contract--the Extended Warranty. Because you will certainly need it !!",

I bought this mini used 6 years ago with the basic mini with minimum features because it was what I could afford at the time.  It was a stickshift.  I loved driving it, it made driving fun again because I hate to drive at all.  Then I became a mom and decided that I didnt want to buy a new car yet because I didnt want another car payment ( I dont like to drown in car debt).  It was difficult to get my daughter in and out with the car seat but once she was old enough to climb in and was forward facing, it was fine.  Overall very minimal cost as far as repairs, minor maintenance.  The only thing that went wrong was my radiator got a crack because I drove it too rough in the snow and jumped a curb.  I was going to keep it until it died but 2 weeks ago, it drowned.  My car got stuck in a flood and was totaled due to hurricaine Matthew.  Best part is, I got double the amount back for the car from insurance! It was paid off and still held a great value!  Needless to say, Im buying another MINI! But Im getting a clubman ( better for kids).",

If you're set on a Mini like I was, only buy or lease a new one because when they are close to 100,000 miles they need lots of very expensive work.\n\nMinis are super compact which means when a mechanic needs to get to say, the water pump, he has to take out other parts which results in much higher labor costs. Plus, the parts are expensive.\n\nBought it for $7500, put a couple thousand dollars into replacing the water pump, water pipe, radiator, thermostat, AC, brake rotors, and battery...and two years later could only get $1800 after the transmission went out. \n\nI had it inspected prior to purchase and pretty much everything checked out, other than the mechanic saying I'd need new brake rotors.\n\nDon't make the same mistake. Minis are SO fun and great for parking and gas, but the cost of repairs on an older Mini gets to be traumatizing. They're just not meant to be driven past 95,000 miles.",

I am writing this review for people who are considering buying this car for frequent long trips. The car is a blast but I'm not sure I would purchase again because of all the long trips I take. In 14 months I have driven this car almost 60k mi. To be honest, the interior is not very comfortable. After driving about 2 hours on the hwy I start to get fidgety. Being in the passenger seat is almost unbearable after 1hr. Great gas mileage, but not really any pickup on the highway. I know I sound like I'm complaining. I really love my Mini but if you plan on driving as much as I do, you might want to reconsider.",

It pulls hard from 2500-5000 RPMs, corners like no other, brakes instantly, and looks outstanding (mine's dark grey with a black roof). It's nice to be the envy of everyone on the road, especially others driving a Cooper or Cooper S. In fact, the sense of community with other MINI drivers is one of my favorite aspects of the car.  I was fortunate enough to be in a financial situation where I could afford the JCW, and the slight performance increase (and I mean slight - it's not much) and exclusivity factor made the extra money worth it.  HOWEVER, for anyone more sensible than I, the Cooper S is plenty fun and very much less expensive",

Breaks cost $1600 (front and back). I am pretty sure that the repair numbers were developed by the same people who set prices at the AirPort.  With that said, this is by far one of the most fun convertibles I've ever owned. The 6 speed on this car is second only to a Miata and high end sports cars. The suspension is perfectly balanced. The engine screams (while fuel efficient) giving you the impression of much greater speed. I urge you to consider that one car in your life should be for the \"fun factor\" and nothing more. This car will put a smile on your face with every mile. Just make sure to sell it before the extended warranty runs out!",

Initially all was well, great mileage, fun to drive, moves well but then stuff went from bad to worse. The check engine light came on. I took a day off work, traveled 150 klms and took it to a Mini dealer. They did their exploratory diagnosis and informed me that it needed spark plugs- even though the manual says plugs are good for 100,000. After $580.00 the plugs were changed and the light stayed off for 50 klms. Must need injectors was the next diagnosis for $1200.00. the light stayed off for 1 week even though the mini ran like crap in that week. Traded the mini off at a dealer as I could not sell privately. They say the engine gets a carbon build up which I could maybe understand if I was only running it back and forth to the mailbox but, I was driving it 50k on highways 2 times a day and only using premium fuel.  Very disappointed.  I also own a BMW and This is supposed made by them...must be at their training school side. Not the quality at all.",

The 2005 supercharged was better than the 2010 turbo but they are both maintenance nightmares.  The 2010 is the worst.  Every month there is another check engine light.  These cars, if you buy into the cult of mini that has the money to love every design flaw and gleefully pay for them have known things that always go wrong the thermostat housing, $500, new turbocharger, $1600, they flood and won't start after sitting for a week, $280. Run flat tires $210 each and now there is an airbag error light and the air conditioning quit.  I have spent thousands on this pile of junk and now at 75k miles the engine is getting rough with misfires.  This is the carbon build up due to direct port fuel injection.  This car is an over engineered unreliable nightmare. BMW doesn't give a crap that they pump out junk in a cuddly cutesy package.  They want your money.  At the dealer $21 for a spark plug .  Can't buy a PCV valve, it's built into the valve cover $140.  I can go on for days.  STAY AWAY SRAY AWAY STAY AWAY. The mini is garbage!",

I bought it used and for the first month it was great. Pros: it accelerates well, can park anywhere,and has great fuel economy. Cons: closest dealership is 4 hours (300+ miles) away & getting them to do anything is like pulling teeth, repairs are a nightmare as they are way over what i have ever paid in repairs on any other vehicle, constant breaking down. I can honestly say ihave paid more on this car to fix it then i have actually gotten paid off on it and i have had it almost two years and only driven it less then half of that as repairs usually take a month or more to get done.",

Transmission started make lound noises when shifting and we are just over 50K....  Also, the inside plastic makes so much noise on rough roads, it's very annoying.

I've owned a 1966 Porsche 911, a 1973 Porsche 911s and a 1985 Porsche 930, but I can honestly say my little Mini although it \"ain't a Porsche\", is a blast. I've got 50k on it and my MPG which I never have reset is 37.5 and my average MPH is 58.9 over those 50,000 miles. Top speed, 149......I couldn't get it to 150. Oh well, 149 MPH is pretty fast and it'll get there pretty quick. I truly love my Mini! Had a few minor issues, the weather strip around the windshield disintegrated which I believe was caused by the protective coating spray used on the windshield glass. The speakers on the doors are located just right so your foot hits it when you exit the car, the cover is cracked as  a result. The pano roof gave me some problems on hot days, it wouldn't open. Other than those few issues its been great!",

Performs great although gear-shifting in auto lags a bit. Switching to manual takes care of that. Love the look and roomy interior (cant speak for backseat.) Gas mileage a little less than estimated (27) but still very good (24-25). Sport mode is a little jumpy for city driving (for me) but great for highway. Overall very very pleased with purchase.",

He said if we can wait for a few hours they can fix it. We were so stupid and believed his words, and took the car since we run out of the time stay over there.

But don't do it, unless you have money to burn.  You will be taking this car to the BWM dealer for any maintenance or repairs - need I say more?  And, there are many poor engine parts and defects that you will have to do your homework on to know about and monitor:  value tensioner and guides, thermostat and housing, oil CONSUMPTION.  True, we bought the car used with only 28,500 miles and it was in good condition.  We have babied this car; but now with only 70,100 miles the thermostat locks up, the engine overheats, and the head gasket blew ($2900 min repair).  Before this event it used at least a quart of oil between oil changes, and a good bit more if you took an interstate trip;  and the timing chain noise had been increasing (not yet to the 'death rattle' level).  We babied this car, drove it mildly, and changed the oil early ($90 at dealer).  I'm looking at selling the car for parts (we paid $17,000 used when we bought it) for probably no more than $3000 with bad engine, or a complete engine rebuilt (head gasket, timing chain, and god know what else by a local euro car shop) for about $4500 for a car that now is selling for about $8000 used, in good condition!  Like I said, buy it only if reliability and $$ don't matter to you.",

                    "text": "I owned a 2010 JCW for 7 months. The shortest I ever had a vehicle. I bought it used with under 10K miles. Initally I wanted a fuel efficient small fun car. Albeit small this car really had nothing else going for it. The fun factor wore off already on the second month of ownership when the clutch needed replacement. Since I bought the vehicle from a mini dealer they helped a bit with the cost. I paid 1200 vs the 4000 they initially wanted to charge. After some research I realized it takes 20 hrs of labor to do the job. Everything in this car is so compact that you nearly have to take out the engine for major repairs. I replaced the battery myself and ended up removing  windshield trim pieces to access the battery compartmemt. Sorry not very well engineered. The service departmemt told me that the clut h on Minis can easily burn out every 10K to 20K miles. Another weird Mini fault is that for some reason the engines burn oil. Mini service actually recommends that you check the oil monthly or every 1K miles and refill. In terms of ride quality, this car is terrible. I actually started to develop bak pain from the poor seats and stiff suspension combo. The entire quality is cheap for a car in this price range. Performance was fun at first, but I soon realized that there are plenty of other options out there. This car handles like a go cart so you get the illusion of speed. Fun on twisty roads but when you feel every little bump in your lower bak the fun wears out quick. I chose to purchase this car because Mini always intrigued me, now I learned my lesson and will never go back. After only 7 months of ownership I went back to a normal car not needing so much tlc and $$$. If you are the kiND of person that purchases a car for dependability, resale value, efficiency, comfort, etc this is not the car for you.",

From the Harmon Kardon audio, to more comfortable interior, this car has exceeded my wife's expectations as well as my own.  The only downside is the recommendation not to exceed 4000 RPM during the first 1000 miles-this car is begging to be motored...we cannot wait to feel the redline performance of this car.  As for Breaking, you tap the pedal and the brakes grab, and grab hard-the seat belts are more for controlled breaking than inmpact!  You will appreciate the stopping power-you will love the acceleration and burble of the engine and exhaust!",

This turns out to be VERY common with Minis when you go to the various forums.  The car will sputter on acceleration, take up to 10 seconds to turn over in the morning, etc. and the problem only worsens unless tended to.  Cost at an independent mechanic to fix? $650.\n\nAnother common problem is dirty injectors at this point.\n\nOh, and it needs a full synthetic oil....so, when you were hoping to get the $19.99 oil change at Car-X, it quickly triples that cost. :/\n\nAnd the brakes are about gone now, too, despite mostly highway driving.\n\nAnd the worst part? Don't get a flat tire. There is NO SPARE. NONE. \n\n\nThe only good part of this car is the gas mileage, but even then, it's not as good as other manuals out there.

Can't fix anything unless you have a pix or video to show the problem. Was missing parts from the factory also. Problems still exist. BMW USA offered to replace the car because of all the problems, then changes their mind the next day when we were going to take their offer. Be very careful if you decide to purchase this car from Mini(BMW USA), they do not stand behind their product. Guess that is why there is the LEMON LAW. May have to go to court to get relief. Very disappointed with what was suppose to be a superior company and product.",

I took a 700 mile trip north and avg 46 mpg on a flat expressway with keeping the speed of 65mph. If you go above that MPG will not be as great. 70 mph not bad and still received 42mpg. Keep your foot out of it and shift easy 32-35mpg in city shouldn't be a problem. I installed a K&N Typhoon kit and sounds great and improved MPG. I looked at many other cars in the same type of class. This one gave me the most personal room. It's bigger than you think on the inside. I can even fit my kids booster seats in.

The car is amazing, very high tech with all the amenities of a luxury car.  It is so much fun to drive and I am getting better than 33mpg overall. With the back seats folded down there is plenty of space for trips to Costco, etc.  I especially like the 3 year no cost maintenance and the 4/50 bumper to bumper warranty.

Car is CONSTANTLY in need of repair. To date, I've replaced the ignition coils and spark plugs three times apiece--THREE TIMES!-- plus hoses, a water pump, drive wheel, fly wheel, water pump pulley, and the AC compressor. Now, the radio is fried and the replacement is $1,000.00 installed. \n\nIt's hugely expensive and frustrating, and I would NEVER buy another MINI. I've spoke with the customer relations team several times, and although they are very nice and do their best to placate customers, that's all they do--placate you. There is never an actual solution provided. I'm hoping a class-action suit is filed against MINI soon, because I believe they are defrauding consumers with poorly-built cars and hiding the true costs of ownership. This is the worst ownership experience I've had in 25+ years of driving.",

After driving the standard Cooper hardtop the difference was night and day... if you can't afford the S, don't drive one. \n\nI also have a Lotus Elise & have been driving both up the same canyon road to observe the differences. The Lotus corners quicker/flatter, but the Cooper launches you out of a corner with more low end (turbo) thrust. Its power is in the midrange and it flings you forward from around 3,000 RPM. What a blast. It leans a bit while cornering but stays neutral when you hit the gas so you don't need to enter a turn super fast to maintain speed. Great fun, great car. \n\n",

Other reviews reveal the same type of problems including potential failure of the timing chain tensioner which is a similar failure and cost to repair.  Just before this I replace the water inlet / thermostat at the dealer for $600.  This was required to pass emission test.  I am selling the car as soon as I get it back from the shop.  Great fun to drive but be prepared to pay for the privilege.  Too bad BMW couldn't duplicate their impressive engineering results in the Mini.",

                    "text": "2011 Mini Cooper S Convertible.  5 years old with only 34,000 miles on it.  Garage Queen.  Why?  IT IS ALWAYS IN THE REPAIR SHOP!!!!!!!  $1000.00 for a thermostat replacement.  $1,600.00 for a high pressure fuel pump.  And the list goes on.  So much fun to drive!  So expensive to own.  There is ALWAYS SOMETHING going wrong with this thing.  I can't wait to unload it and get something that doesn't cost me an extra $1,000/month in repair bills.\n\n10/18/2016 Update:  A Customer Service Tale: So I sent an email to miniusa and a few DAYS later, my wife gets a voicemail on her cell phone from someone named Andrew W. at MINIUSA.  She provides me the number: 866-275-6464.  I call it.  I work my way through their tortuous automated system, that has a hard time understanding what you are saying when it prompts you to say what you need from their list of the menu items.  I leave a message at Andrews extension, 7992.  He doesn't call back.  I call again today.  I get a kind woman who updates my phone information, then sends me along to Andrew W's extension 7992.  Andrew W's voicemail says he is not in (again) and says to leave a message, then tells you his voicemail is full.  But..., if you want to speak to a Customer Service Representative, you can dial \"0\".  So, I press 0 and it tells me that Customer Service is not available (It is 10:30 on a Tuesday morning) AND that their voice mail is full also.  So, I call back again and this time I ask directly for Customer Service Representative.  I tell her what just happened and she tells me that she sees on her screen that Andrew just wants to tell me that he can't do anything for me because I had repairs done at a non-mini dealership.  Why did I do that?  Because my 2011 mini at 34,000 miles is out of warranty anyway and the dealership wanted TWO TIMES the price that the aftermarket auto wanted to do the exact same thermostat repair.  The High Pressure Fuel Pump replacement that the dealership wanted $2,200.00 to replace, was also done at the aftermarket repair shop for $1,200.00.  I do not know who is in charge of MINIUSA, but my friend, if you are reading this..., you have some serious repairs to make of your own..., with your organization.  You may be experiencing records sales and having the best year ever.  I do not know.  But when customer service has no semblance of service to it whatsoever, and even your automated system to handle consumer problems is so ineffective that there is no operator available and everyone's voicemail is \"full\", it will all catch up with MINIUSA sooner or later.  It may take a few years but this kind of terrible reliability problems, terrible customer service problems, outrageous repair costs, and complete lack of attention to detail and even to the customer will catch up with you eventually.  And what about BMW?  I am sure they would be embarrassed and humiliated to read how their American operations are being handled.  So, hello BMW.  Why don't you have some of your Executive officers, board members, and senior staff pretend to have a customer situation and try calling through the automated system under a pseudo name and suffer through the same experience your customers experience every single day.  I am so disappointed.  I loved driving my Mini Cooper S Convertible for some time.  But these recent experiences have completely soured me on the whole Mini experience.  I have had nearly a dozen people ask me how I like my Mini over the past 3 months, and I tell them all the same thing: \"A blast to drive when it is working... a nightmare to have repaired... a money pit... zero customer service... and do yourself a favor and never ever buy one.",

I actually found her on the internet, called the dealership, put down a deposit and pickup her that weekend.  The dealership was not a local dealer.  I purchased the Mini with under 50,000 miles on her.  I started having problems around 60,000 miles.  I took her to a local BMW repair shop due to a lack of acceleration.  I was told that she needed an walnut blasting due to carbon build up on the engine intake.  They also replaced plugs and wires....$700.00.  Later, I had a brake (dash) light come on.  I took her back to the repair shop.  I was told she need brake pads, new sensors and rotors.....$900.00.  I did not purchase an extended warrant so this was an out of pocket expense. I was told by the mechanic that everything should be good for awhile. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in Mini...... Well, I now have almost 70,000 miles on her, with no recent problems.  I still must say.....I still love my Mini JAZZ.  She is my midlife crisis...LOL......Deb",

I love the Mini's scary-fast acceleration, it's mountain handling (it dares you to push its handling limits) and the deep bucket seats that keep you stable during driving.\nIt looks great, handles perfectly and makes each trip out a pleasure.\n",

                    "text": "I traded in my trouble plagued 2002 Mini, for what I thought was a major upgrade.  I purchased my 2012 Base Model Mini with manual transmission last Aug. with 31,000 miles.  While driving down to my favorite eatery, shifting from 1st to 2nd shifter know came off in my hand.  I managed to replace it and continued on.  A couple of days later a aprox. 32,000 miles I began to notice a clatter from the engine at first start up in the morning, during the next few weeks it became progressively worse.  I took it to the local Mini dealer and was informed the clatter was the clutch failing.  Being a mechanic for 40 plus years I called BS, told them to keep the car for a cold start test the next day.  Low and behold it was determined the timing chain was at fault, these engines apparently have chain tensioners prone to failure.  The timing chain was replaced along with tensioners and  gears.  The dealer Seattle Mini stuck by their story that my clutch was failing and would be 2400.00 to replace, but offered me an extended warranty that would cover the clutch for 1895.00.  What a way to cover the cost of the warranty work. About 2 weeks after having the work down, the engine began to misfire badly, had it towed to the dealer, they replaced the coil packs for the ignition, and spark plugs and wires.  So here we are today, 41,102 miles, the engine is beginning to clatter again from the exact same location.  Under warranty to 50,000 miles.  Soon as it gets worse to justify the warranty work and before 50,000 miles back in again for another timing chain, followed by a quick trade in for another car, not MINI.  Oh and did I mention that Seattle Mini tried the whole your clutch is failing routine on me a 2nd time with offer of the extended warranty when I took it in for the Misfire problem I mentioned earlier.  By the way the clutch still works perfect, however the manual transmission has always been clunky when shifting, the transition from 1st to 2nd requires a firm pull, it also has no reverse lock out, on 2 separate occasions I have been at a light and forgot to downshift into first, while quickly doing so as to not block traffic, it went into reverse.  Luckily caught it before I hit someone behind me.  Been driving manual for years.",

I've only had a couple of issues, 1) the service engine light came on\nafter a few months and the dealer said I must have put regular gas in it, not the premium, and 2) the door is hard to open sometimes.

I am a commuter from a rural area into a college town and was looking for an economy car, but not one that was underpowered or cheap. This is likely to be the brand I stick with for awhile, they are SO fun to drive and cannot be beat in city traffic (only two wheels have it better). It feels safe because you know that the car has very respectable handling and power to get you around, and deal with occasional poor drivers on the open roads. Rather expensive based on size alone, it has taken the miles and years of ownership to gain a greater appreciation.",

Now, less than a week after its second service I am sitting on the side of the freeway, waiting the hour and a half for Mini Roadside Assistance to come get me.  My clutch went out at a little over 18,000 miles.  I know enough about cars to know that when you let the clutch out and give it some gas it should go forward.  All I get is a revving engine.

Right after warranty expired we had to replace brakes and rotors and battery.  The transmission stalls in first gear after stopping at a light, but only on hot days.  The water pump is bad and leaks coolant; $900 fix at the dealer. The water pump goes bad a lot on this mini; you conveniently do not have a Temp gauge!  It also leaks oil from the valve solenoid; $2500 fix at the dealer.  Overall worst vehicle I have ever owned, period.  ",

I asked them to recalibrate my speedometer which is running about 7% high. They refused, quoting an internal bulletin not to repair speedometers that are within 10% of accurate plus another 2.4 miles. I.e., if you and your Garmin know you are driving at 65 mph, your speedometer will not be recalibrated unless it is displays OVER 74 mph.\nSo much for their claim that they fix new cars.\nI even bought the extra coverage so this \"guarantee\" would continue for extra years.\nI would never buy another Mini Cooper. Still talking, but I may have to sue to get my new car fixed.",

I think you either love this car or hate it. My wife loves it, I hate it.  Its her daily driver, so there you go.  Its a small car. I knew that. Realize you are basically buying a 2 seat micro-car.  I'm 5-8 and skinny and think this car feels cramped, and i grew up driving all models of small air cooled VW's.  You might as well fold the back seats down and use it as trunk space.  My 8 & 10 year olds have no leg room and barely get space to plant their feet when 5'-4\" mom is driving.  Don't tell me adults can fit back there! I *Hate* the Mini-Connected system with it's joystick and horrible look/software. Confusing, not user friendly. In the world of touch screen everywhere, this lack of, is archaic. The seatbelts get caught between the seats and door post. You have to open the door to get your buckle. The seats are hard to adjust to get right and comfortable. Too many confusing dash switches. Hard to get to the back seat. Ugh, glad I leased not bought!!!  If you like the old school, kind of meets the future, this is your car. Mini holds onto stuff like retro toggle switches, the big bezel dial like speedometer, but then puts a tiny digital box on top of the steering column with a digital speedo, outside weather temp, etc, but it takes like 5 different presses of a button to get to different parts of the display and the screen is too small to be useful. Spring for the black wheels. The stock silver are always dirty and a pain to get and keep clean. I gave up.\n\n***Update*** 2016: After 3 years, glad I am turning the car back in at the end of the lease. If you really want a mini, test drive an \"S\" and the standard engine. I think the standard is underpowered. The freeway noise (lack of noise insulation throughout the car) and the god awful mini connected interface are the worst things about this car. Don't fall for the sales pitch to buy the extended tire care warranty. The run-flat tires are expensive to replace, but not as fragile as the dealer makes them out to be. They made claims that curbs and potholes would cause them to blow out easy.  Never had an issue with them, not even a nail in the tire...",

The Sport button adds a little bit of a \"race car\" element to my commute. The best part, though, is the customer service.

Not only has it been extremely reliable, but the handling on this car is amazing. When people say their car \"hugs the road,\" they really have no idea what that means until they drive a Cooper. Taking a hard turn at 40 mph feels no different than at 10 mph in another car. I feel safer in my MINI than I do in any other car I've driven. \n\nI actually get a higher mpg than listed here. So far I average about 42mpg highway and 38 mpg on surface streets. ",

The warranty seemed perfectly acceptable and we were very happy with the purchase. We put about 25,000 miles on this car in one year and we only brought it in for oil changes and recall repairs. So far, so good. The car handles well, gets good MPG, and does what we expect it to do. Then, the car broke down while my wife was driving through town, on her way home from work.\n\nThe dealer took about one week to diagnose the problem, claiming the service department was short-handed. The following week, I was told that the turbo charger would need to be replaced, and when I checked in two days later, the engine also needed to be replaced. I have owned several new cars, and I have never had a problem with the engine in the first year of driving. In fact, I have never had engine problems within the first 100,000 miles of any engine. Naturally, I was concerned. I asked about replacement parts, and of course, the exact same OEM parts that had failed already were being installed. I tell them that's fine, but I would like to have an extended warranty so that these new parts, including the engine, would be covered for longer in case the same problem repeats. This was also denied. I have spoken to MINI USA several times, and there is nothing they will do that is not already covered. \n\nPlease understand, the car is well within warranty and I have incurred no additional cost. Not yet, anyway. However, the car has been in the shop for three weeks now, and counting. Getting an extended warranty is pointless now, because I will be unloading this car at my earliest opportunity. I will replace my MINI with a reliable car, and never consider purchasing another in the future.",

                    "text": "This is the worst car that I have ever owned.  I have had a alpha romeo spider veloce, honda crv and one other car for over 10 years each with over 150,000 miles on them.  This car is cheaply and poorly made and was more expensive than both of them.  In the first year that I owned it all of the electrical wiring went and I had to have it towed in, less than 7,000 miles.  Covered by the warranty $8,000 plus.  The following winter the water pump went and I had to have it towed in yet again.  In year 3 the drivers seat started to frwy whith less than 20,000 miles.  Last year the brakes were falling apart and they had to be changed when the car only had about 24,000 miles on it.  I am at the dealer yet again 6 months later and although I purchased an extended warranty most of it isn't covered.  $600 plus to have the hood fixed because it won't open because the original cheap parts have rusted in 4 years.  Another $400 plus for new spark plugs and something else because the engine is malfunctioning with only 31,000 miles in the car.  Another oil change because all the oil leaked and I couldn't get to it since the cable broke to open the hood.  Inferior parts and quality.  Run from this vehicle and buy a Honda, Toyota or Subaru.  I can not recommend this car to anyone and will never buy another.  But at least it's paid for!",

In a Mini, it remains attached to the engine, and the thrust bearing rotates with the engine with a lot of force on this half inch steel bearing.  The flywheel is a dual mass, suitable for today's drivers who do not know how to let out a clutch.  Finally, clutches are supposed to match the horsepower of the engine.  The clutch is sized for the standard 124 HP engine.  The JCW has the same engine, but with tuning and turbo puts out 208 HP.  The clutch in my Mini has now been replaced 4 times in 36000 miles of driving.  BMW which owns Mini runs it's warranty program.  95% of their calls involve BMWs.  BMW uses a traditional clutch and its clutches are matched to the engine.  So they do not understand the problems faced by Mini JCW owners.  I have a 4 year 50,000 warranty on my car, purchased in June 2012.  Yet BMW refuses to pay the $1700 bill to replace my clutch.  Heavy duty clutches are available for the Mini because the clutch fails so often.  They cost $1300.  They have a ceramic bearing that won't burn out.  Mini dealers have special equipment to replace clutches because they break so often.  It costs about $5000.  So chances are that your mechanic does not have this equipment.  My Mini dealer refuses to even touch a heavy duty clutch since their agreement with Mini USA requires them to only use Mini parts, which are unreliable.\nIf you buy a Mini JCW, you can expect the clutch to fail about once a year.  It takes 3 days to get a clutch installed.",

Freeway driving is a breeze, as long as you, the driver, realized your MINI Cooper (non-turbo) is no race or fast car.  It's a very simple 1600 cc's of raw BMW power.  They should use that line in their advertisements.  The car and its payment went to my ex-husband when I left him.  He wanted it.  He loves it.  At 74\" he is very comfortable in the car with top up or down.  So, the rest of this review is his.   \n\nToby, that is her name, performs exactly the way I had hoped she would perform.  Whether in the city (stop or go traffic) or on the highway, she does an excellent job.  I do not drive her fast.  She simply isn't fast.  I didn't want \"fast\" so, she is perfect.  For me.  At my age.  I got this car because it was a convertible, leather interior, a wonderful color combination for the exterior with a very comfortable ride and superior sound system.  Toby is a Highgate package with the Harmon-Kardon sound system (a 'must-have' in my mind).  I truly cannot think of anything else to say about the car, as it is just a superb automobile in spite of its price tag.  I got what I wanted: A well thought-out, high mileage, comfortable drop-top.  When I'm 80, please stay off the sidewalks.  I'll be driving on them!",

Still clunks over bumps. $30,000.00 clunker I guess. I think they want me to go away and just make my payments and be quiet.  Gasket coming out of side window !! Really ? BMW product ? 10k miles the windshield shows pitting !  No dipstick to check oil ?  The radio is impossible to navigate , to complexed.

The ride, handling, performance, gas mileage, acceleration, and storage capability (with the rear seats down) are superb for a car of this class. Fit and finishes are great on the newer models, especially, with improved ride (sporty, yet forgiving) and the Harman Kardon sound system, which will blow you away. This car is built to last. And, the 4-cylinder turbocharged engine is definitely the only way to go. It provides plenty of get-up-and-go...especially on the highway and for longer trips. Of course, parking in the city is a breeze...",

My I phone fits like a glove and is really secure in their. By far the handling of the car is outstanding.  In the round about circles I actually had a guy in a Ford Fusion trying to stay with me, his line was good but he was under steereing badly. He almost whacked the curb on the outside realizing he couldn't run with the Mini in the tight corners.  Another thing I like is how the rear seats fold down and the tray in the \"trunk\" can be moved to be level with the folded down seats. With this it also increases the amount of stuff you can get in that space.",

I actually have to flip through all the menu's again to find it. So my small issues are with the media package ",

The car is equipped with an engine shut off when you come to a complete stop (you can disable this if you want) its a great fuel saver. The three modes you can part the car into actually have charter in each mode.  In sport mode the comes alive and you can hear the waste gate working and the blow off valve chirping.  Also the exhaust has a back fire rumble to it.  In a few round about circles I had an issue with \"flying objects\"... this car handles like a go kart and anything not secured or in the glove box can go flying and hit the door/window!!! ",

I have contacted Mini...they say it's Apple...Apple says it's Mini...Meanwhile dealerships don't seem to have the answers either...not enough training at some of the high tech levels at some of the dealerships...I found a round about way to do so by connecting Pandora...but then I was using data...Upon further research of this problem, it appears there have been others with similar problems which still have not been addressed by Mini.  I did get Mini Corp and Apple on the phone together today.  Mini says they are looking into it and will get back to me...so I can't judge or say for certain what the outcome will be...but it is frustrating not to be able to get my navigation through the speakers.  Other than that the car drives great.  Amazing amount of power in this little guy.  Seats are extremely comfortable.  I love the heated seats during the cold winter days.  Like the added side visor on the driver's side of the car...perfect to keep that sun out of your eyes.  Sound system of Harman Kardon is great! More room than you think in the 4 door once seats are down.  Nice area to hide valuables in the back storage area as well.  Wish the keyless entry was just a simple touch with a finger instead of a push...but not I'm getting picky.  Also wish the fob created a sound from the car when you pressed it...that always helped me find my car.  Not as stiff a ride as I though it would be...big improvements from previous models.  Also, it's getting just ok gas mileage...I was spoiled by a Prius C before though.  This one eats Premium. But all in all, I think it's a very attractive vehicle and once I get this nagging navigation situation resolved will like it even better!  PS Did not like the \"S\" seats...I found them not so great for short people...However, I have heard that taller people really like them.  Glad I had a choice.",

                    "text": "Mini Cooper provides a 3 year warranty on the car, but BMW refuses to honor it.  BMW makes the engine, clutch, and transmission for Mini Cooper.  To simplify logistics, they use the same clutch on all their Mini drive chains.  As an engineer, I know that the first rule for choosing a clutch for a car is that it should be able to handle the torque produced by the engine.  The Mini clutch was designed for the standard 140 HP Mini engine.  The JCW comes with 208 HP.  To make matters worse, the Mini clutch is backwards from standard clutches.  During shifting, the clutch disengages the transmission and not the engine.  That means that the thrust bearing continues to rotate while handling a lot of load.  The standard half inch steel bearing cannot hold up to the 208 HP engine.  There is an easy fix to this problem which engineers know about.  You replace the half inch steel bearing with a three quarter inch ceramic bearing made to handle the horsepower.  To save less that $10 per car, BMW decided not to do this.  Therefore their clutches wear out.  The last time my clutch failed, about 2 years after purchase with a three year warranty, BMW refused to pay for my warranty repair, and I am out about $2000.  \nI asked my dealer to use a heavy duty clutch which I would buy during this last repair.  But their contract with Mini Cooper doesn't allow them to use any parts but BMW parts.  BMW tells me that I do not know how to drive a clutched car.  I have driven Saabs with standard transmissions and clutches for over 20 years and have never had a clutch failure.  I currently drive a 1999 Saab 9-3 convertible with 150,000 miles on it, with the original clutch still working fine.",

So I can forgive many other things that aren't perfect, such as a tight fit getting in and out of the car.  You learn \"how\" to get in and out of the car, so it works.  My husband is 6'2\" and weighs 270lb.  He has learned how to get in and says it is comfortable for him to drive and be a front passenger, but he can't sit in the back seat.  My adult child is not small and she can sit in the back seat comfortably.  The back cargo area has enough space for me to get a weeks worth of groceries in to. If we have other larger things we need to haul, we can put the seats down and it usually works.  It's not an SUV, so doesn't have the room that an SUV has.  We have to have bigger items delivered. My other choice of car was a Subaru Forester XT touring, but it was too expensive to get what I wanted and the navigation and bluetooth on it weren't nearly as good as my mini.   The dealership I bought my mini at only sold their cars with summer tires.  I would have liked all season tires which would be better in the snow.  I love the navigation system, I will upgrade it every other year or so.  I like the bluetooth, the streaming music, the folding mirrors, the acceleration, the handling, The bottom line...When you step on the gas, it goes...fast. And,....I get better gas mileage than was stated on the window sticker.  Update: Dec 2016. We drove to ID. So glad we decided to get snow tires. The handling isn't sporty. But we can drive in snow. We would not have been able to get around without them, even with all season tires. We will have them stored for when we make winter trips. On this trip we are discovering that there is just not enough room in this car for our needs. Thinking of getting a 2017 Mini Countryman, but then it looks like an SUV and not a mini. I still love the way this one drives though.",

I really enjoy this car, its gets be from point A to point B in a fun, quick and safe. When looking for my first car, I wanted something that was safe, reliable, great on gas, great resale value(even now I wonder why I would ever sale this car). The first time I test drove this car I was hooked, because it is so much fun to drive, I look for curves in the road and hills and valleys, its just fun and even though it is a MINI it has more space then you would think and more room then one would expect. One of my favorite things is that MINI gave creative thought to the small things like where the gas tank is located, the way your MINI will wink at you when you get in, the heartbeat of the car, mood lighting etc. Even though it has all these fun things the car is crazy safe, like the gas tank cut off if you are in an accident to keep from fire, the 8 air bags and so many other things. I would highly recommend this car to anyone because it's more than just cute and fun but safe and reliable.",

                    "text": "The point of view of this review is from a long time BMW MINI owner who, up until now, loved them.  It probably isn't relevant to those who haven't previously had a MINI.  Back in the '60, Ford had a great, innovative car that was very popular.  Each new version of it became bigger and bigger and sought to reach a wider market.  Eventually, it became a parody of itself, becoming virtually a 2 door family sedan.  Fortunately, Ford saw the light and the car has returned (sort of) to its roots. I am referring to the Mustang.  Well, it seems BMW is following that same sorry route with the MINI.  What was the attraction of the BWM MINI?  It's SMALL size, its uniqueness, its fun to drive-ness. As one local reviewer (in Maryland) wrote, driving a MINI was therapy.  So, what has happened.  To address the \"negatives\" appearing in professional reviews, which value every car against some homogeneous (with the exception, perhaps, of exotics and rockets), BMW is turning the MINI into just another compact car.  They have tried to make up for this by adding high-tech gimmickry, like color-changing LEDs and artificial sound effects, which serve only to make a cartoon out of the car.  The car has gotten huge compared to the previous MINIs. If you are buying this car for rear seat room and a living room on wheels ride, you are in the wrong place.  The 2015/2016 MINI hardtops are almost indistinguishable from the Countryman, both viewed from the outside and when sitting inside. This isn't because the Countryman is tiny.  On the technical side, one could say everything is \"improved\" except for the 3 cylinder engine in the base model. While it is surprisingly peppy, it is noisy and rough-idling.  Yes, there are now many MINIs on the road. So, from BMW's perspective, they are on the right path. But, if you are a Miniac for the initial BMW MINI offerings, you will most likely not be happy driving this one.  Let's hope BMW, like Ford, will come to its senses.  Eventually, Mr./Ms. average driver will tire of the cramped size, the \"hard\" ride and the \"weird\" stuff that might still remain and those who remember what a MINI was will return.  In the meantime, I'll probably be in a Miata or a GTI.",

I must admit that on deteriorated pavements at low speed it is not where it shines, otherwise the drive is rewarding.\nThe options include most packages except HK radio, connectivity and gps, the leather seats are really nice and comfortable.\nI used to drive in a more spirited way, the green setting made me zen to some point so I get an average of 35 mpg in mix driving so far.\nAfter one year and 10000 miles, I got a real average of 33.6 mpg on a mostly city driving which is impressive, the computer indicates around 35.\nThe sports seats with leather option are comfortable but non tilt adjustable which is a major issue, since leather and sport seats are a 2000$ option.\nTechnology is very basic, there is no back up camera etc, I would have expected more on a car with that price tag.\nKeep on driving, at the wheel you are in another world.",

                    "text": "I have my own opinions that sometimes run counter to the popular view. Case in point are some aspects of the 2016 Mini Cooper hard top. We recently bought mostly for its quirky charm unfortunately not because of its handling. \n\nWe ordered a base cooper with the 15\" wheels but with the default performance tires. The handling isn't as good as I hoped. It has personality like the rest of the car although I'd hoped for it to just work. Steering is responsive, however the car fishtails in quick maneuvers. It fact it's one of the worst I've driven testing by swishing the steering wheel side to side. The rear reacts violently after a long delay like the back is whipping around later. Can be scary on the expressway. We tried 16\" wheels and they're a little better but not great. Many other cars this size do better on this test. \nThe other thing I don't like is the Harmon Kardon upgraded stereo. It has way too much bass. If that all you want to hear, maybe it's fine but I rank it as practically unlistenable even with the bass turned way down. The Fender upgraded stereo in VWs are awesome. Awesome bass yet clarity. \nWe didn't order the upgraded stereo. The base stereo is fine and sounds clearer. \nThe little 1.5 liter 3 cylinder engine is great. Has lots of low end torque, is happy to rev, and is surprisingly quiet. \nManual transmission is very good. Nice fairly short throw. Rev matching on downshifts, hill hold. \nI test drove automatics. It works well in most cases but I got it confused when I jumped out in traffic and it took an eternity (maybe a second or two) to decide what gear to go into, all while cars were bearing down on me. \nInterior is small but can be comfortable is people aren't too big. \nSunroof is amazing. Feels like your in a convertible. \nOverall ride is very solid. Stiff body, normally few rattles, good at absorbing bumps. \nStorage space is definitely lacking. Mini went cheap for 2016 and removed the secret compartment on the dashboard reducing storage space that's practically non existent. \nWho's idea was it to make a four door car and only have one cupboard in the rear seat?\nOverall a fun cute car but with sometimes poor handling with the base wheels.",

I have only had my gorgeous mini one day, but these first 25 miles have been amazing. The interior is incredible, reminds you of glancing in a Porsche, or at least an Audi.  As someone who has had a Volvo, three Camrys, and a Tundra, I know what quality is, and I don't mind paying a little more for it. I'm looking forward to taking dad up to Big Bear in it tomorrow. Then it's on to visit the eldest son, up near Oakland. No more worrying about distances and gas on the card.",

                    "text": "The car runs drives great and is surprisingly smooth going down the highway at 80mph for a short wheelbase auto.  My problem with MINI is their customer service after the sale.  So my wife and I get 60mi outside the Dallas dealership and decide to set up the Sat radio that supposedly came with the car.  After fumbling with the radio trying to find the \"Sat\" setting, I called my sales person back to ask where the setting was, he said he needed to call me back.  A few minutes later we were informed our car is \"Sat Prep\" which means me as the owner has to take the car in at MY expense, buy a $150 Sat code followed by $700 to install software in my factory NAV headset.  This was not explained to us prior to leaving the dealership.  When we called the sales manager back to get this worked out, it was an instant \"there is nothing we can do, we should have worked it into the original deal\".  So at that point when it came to the survey about the dealership, I wrote what happened and in a couple of days got a call from a Dewey Gatts customer relations supervisor on my voicemail to call him back.  And so I did not once, but three times over the course of three days with no phone call back.  Got a hold of another customer service rep who we again laid out our issue too and she sounded promising of helping out.  She said if you have not heard anything in 24-48hrs call back.  Again I called Dewey Gatts POC, and again straight to voicemail, so I called again, got another rep \"Tara\" who was quick to just say what Sat Prep means and that their is nothing they could do.  I posted on MINI USA the following:   \"so there In addition to our previous post about some misleading advertisement about Sat Radio on our new car, we have been back and forth with MINI customer relations since we have not been able to get a call back from our case manager Dewey Gatts.  We have waited the 48hrs to hear back on our case since Dewey Gatts will not call us despite the 3 different times I left my number on his voicemail to call.  When we asked the customer relations rep named Tara who the relations supervisor was so we could get some resolve on our case (at this point she started telling us there is nothing they could do), she could not tell us who it was, Tara kept telling us the next level are all supervisors.  What?? All departments regardless of business type have ONE person/manager who is in charge and then that Manager has someone s/he has to answer to as well.  You mean to tell me you cannot tell me who your own boss is?  or who your boss' boss is?  MINI you have something seriously wrong in with your customer service reps if they cannot tell me who their direct line of supervisors are much less can provide a phone contact.  MINI has put a huge damper on my \"Motoring\" experience.  This type of customer service shows what MINI USA's true colors are in order to resolve an issue.  If anyone is thinking of buying a MINI, you better have your homework down on what you want because MINI will use any misinterpretations to their advantage and continue to blow you off until you give up.  The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I so should have bought a Fiat 500 or Chevy Spark that I was looking at in conjunction to this car. I know Ford, Dodge, and Chevy customer relations at least make an effort to right a wrong.  MINI you have just lost a customer, we were planning to trade our Ram 1500 in next year for a Countryman but that will absolutely not happen at this point, I will stick with American or Japanese for next purchase\".",

Handling is superb... we have the base trim with 3 cylinder, but the 172 max torque makes a quick spin and cornering capability.  16 inch sport wheels and tires provide just the right amount of road holding ability and stopping power.  We have the 195/16 runflat tires as part of the sport package.  Navigator is great, clear instruction and great voice command functions.  Rear view camera and parking sensors work perfectly for tight parking spots.  The seats are very comfortable.  We love the dual sunroofs as well, and the Harmon Kardon sound system with unlimited tweeter sound and bass.  The exhaust note is sporty.  Our out-of-the-door price was $27,350 with $5,500 discount right around 2015 X'mas time.  Dealer even gave us rear tinted windows for free.  Nice!!  Thanks.  I and my wife both enjoy driving it every minute.  Great commuter and sporty little machine.",

The problem is this car is a potential  money pit. I've spent over $5000 on repairs: timing chain, oil pump, water pump, low engine oil pressure etc...you name it. This Mini is not a durable car, and should never be purchase with more than 50,000 miles. I receive class-action lawsuit notices against Mini on all the issues I've had to deal with almost every three months. Obviously, I'm not the only owner dealing with these re-occurring issues. My advice is to stay away from this vehicle unless you have unlimited funds for repair or know a Mini repairman who works extremely cheap.",

A year later, brand new engine had a main bearing failure... paid out-of pocket.   Super fun car,  but not worth the cost.  Shame on BMW for being associated with the 2008 model year.",

This forced owners to either pay 5x+ the normal, or let their car sit in the shop waiting for BMW to make the part orderable again. The tensioner is a known problem, and is the subject of a class action suit being discussed. ",

And yes, we both know how to drive a clutch. Our other manuals haven't needed one yet. The plastic thermostat housing cracked and BMW was out of stock for weeks on end (new inventory system screwup). Never spent $800 to replace a thermostat before - that's crazy. The back passenger door has sticking issues from day one. Then it stuck open!! Thus making the car unusable. Time chain tensioner broke. Car has > $10,000 in repairs so far, plus the normal maintenance costs. That's simply unacceptable.",

Very comfortable for road trips, with firm seats and real lumbar support with the upgraded upholstery.  It does have a very firm ride, and the sport package is only for masochists.  I plan on switching out the run flats when they wear out with regular tires to ease the bumpiness.  The roads here in Minnesota are bad.  If you can find a twisty road it is sublime.  I test drove all the varieties, and I think the Auto base is a bit underpowered.  The Manual base is ok.  Obviously the S in either version rocks.  But switch the MPH over to the RPM gauge, as I hit 100 when passing without noticing.",

The car is very well engineered but had some minor defects when delivered (not a surprise), which are still being fixed after 5 weeks (a surprise). The biggest surprise is that the car is a fantastic highway cruiser! It's amazingly stable at high speeds. You don't feel the speed, so you need to be very careful that you don't go 90 in a 55!",

It was a great ride since I had owned a MG Midget years earlier, so I knew how these little cars feel.  But, in 2015 all the problems started with engine light coming on over and over again with these dates and findings, \n\n1) June 2015 - Jan. 2016 a chasing oil leak four times ($ 300 a pop), 2)  \nApril 2015 timing chain failure (covered by Mini),  \nFeb. 2016 crack in oil line ( ($750), \nMarch 2016 (twice in the shop) another oil leak ($675 each time).  \nApril 2016 when I checked the oil and found there was none in the reservoir. The idiot that had worked on my car at the dealer had forgotten to place oil back in after the second March 2016 repair (the service manager said he had been fired due to other complaints) I found this out when I left he vehicle for four (4) days stay at the dealer (I always had it serviced at the Dealer to keep the records accessible) and\nApril 2016 I was told another oil leak and vacuum hose issue ($1,100). \nMay 2016 -A week later, the engine light was back on, this time carbon build-up ($2,700). \n\nI spent  total of $7,100 on this vehicle from June 2015 to May 2016. Needless to say, I sold (not traded it in) it in a private sale to a guy that collects cars and wanted a 2009 Mini. He did not care about the issues, he just wanted the car and paid the price I asked. It was shipped from Charleston, SC to San Diego, CA on his dime. I purchased a 2016 Outback. Why? I just could not bring myself to trust the Mini mechanics after the oil misstep.",

The engines probably love this feature but it is complicated. A big yellow light tells you that the temperature is 32 but you never get a similar warning for important things such as oil level low.",

This car has a great exhaust note and lots of low end grunt for a low displacement engine. Not only is it fast, fun, and efficient, but it's also quite practical.\nIt's a small car, don't get me wrong, but It's surprisingly spacious inside.\nWith the back seats down it has great storage space.

With the 6 speed, I am never without the power I need.\nI travel quite a bit and met 2 BMW engineers. Both said the 6 speed base Cooper w/ sport assist is a great car.

We put the car on the road for a 2500- mile summer road trip; performance was great and mileage was *fantastic* (~41MPG on the highway), but we found that the passenger-side carpets were wet.  We had to diagnose the problem via the MINI discussion boards on the internet, and traced it to a poorly installed gasket in the A/C system.   Other problems included rear-door seals that didn't seal, an inaccurate speedometer, and shut-downs due to bad throttle assemblies.   After ~5 repair trips in 12,000 miles, the dealer replaced the car, so we now own a 2010 - with a gas gauge that doesn't really work.",

Don't put barefoot kids or anything delicate in the backseat floor because the runners that slide the seats are incredibly sharp, exposed metal. They punctured a 2L soda bottle recently. It got under the carpet, and the dealer wanted $900 to dry it out, claiming no fault because cargo belongs in the cargo area (duh? but sharp metal is ok for people?) My auto body guy did it for $300.

Handling and braking are outstanding and the base model has enough power for most situations.  Once you commit yourself to revving it higher and downshifting when required, the power is adequate.  It's been reliable through the first 4,000 miles and have averaged 32mpg in traffic.

Given the Clubby is under warranty but when I learn that brake replacement can approach $1K or higher, that concerns me. IMO, the whole MINI culture/concept not only includes the original purchase price but also the ongoing highly expensive maintenance. I will watch these reviews closely as the 2008 Clubby lose warranty coverage. ",

My wife talked me into buying the Clubman.  I thought it was too expensive for what you get.  And the options are too expensive and too numerous.  However, the little beast has totally grown on me and made me a MINI convert.  The S is fast enough for most enthusiasts and it handles like MINI says: Like a go-cart.  It's small to be sure, but when you're inside it feels much bigger.  Never thought I would say this, but I love this expensive toy car.",

Overall, I love it. It's surprisingly roomy inside for a small car, We have a 4 yr old boy and it's perfect - thats why we opted for the clubman. The Mini has more noises than I can identify, but that becomes one of it's charm. The clubman is not a \"pretty\"car, but I think thats what I like about it. Only regrets are the \"pleather\" seats; they are too hot in the summer. The stereo is not that good either, but I find I am less interested in what I am listening to and more interested in the drive. Definitely Fun and different!",

We took the Clubman on a 2500 mile vacation trip (a bit hesitantly since there aren`t that many dealerships cross country) after purchase and it performed flawlessly.  Loved driving every mile! The service at the dealership is awesome and their customer service is one reason why I purchased another mini.  I gotta admit, I do like the clubman better than the mini...feels more stable. And the turbo is exceptional.  When the Mini 4 wheel drive debuts in 2010, we`re gonna look at that.  Overall, the mini is a great riding, handling vehicle. Love the shifting with the 6 speed.",

I have liked mini's for a while but they were just not practical until now, I love the extra space, and once the seats are folded down its surprising how much you can get in there!!  The ride is alot smoother than the regular cooper. Does not quite corner as a regular cooper, but I'm not a race car driver either.",

I haven't had any real problems with the size of the car, it fits anywhere and with the clubman's back doors, everything fits. The clubman S has a lot of power and when I'm not paying attention it surprises me still.

Oil changes and brakes can be done yourself for minimal cost.    Excellent gas mikage. Typically on freeway 40+ mph.  You will find each mini has its own gremlins.  Mine will ONLY take certain types of gas or she gets very upset! They all have their quirky personalities but overall a joy to drive. Mine makes regular Costco trips  packs 6 foot football players and gear and my 6 ft husband loves to drive it and has plenty of headroom. Overall very happy with mine.",

Car developed a couple of coolant leaks and $4,000 and two days later we were back on the road. The Clubman is actually comfortable for four and we have taken several roadtrips without complaints. With the manual ( very nice 6 spd) we can get as high as 39 miles to the gallon. We ordered the upgraded stereo and it is worth it. Bottom line is that the car is very fun, and cute. I would recommend buying the extended maintenance plan - it is a bitter pill but can save you lots of money down the road. A Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla will be more reliable but styling is terrible - absolutely neutral.",

After my mechanic examined the engine, I see plastic parts attached to the engine???  Exhaust manifold had a stripped screw that was glued back in place???  $485 for a new plastic exhaust manifold.  I was told BMW's have plastic parts as well.  I go to wash the car and find a crack in the windshield that started on the top edge??  Dealer wants $800+ to replace.  Found a mobile windshield company to replace for $230.  Will sell when it reaches 85,000 miles.  No more German cars for me.",

My Clubman is great for mountain biking, kayaking, surfing and has room for my home depot trips. I would highly recommend this car. Love My Mini! ",

In general the interior is comfortable but there are few quirks.  I don't like the placement of the power window controls which are right in back of the cup holders.  With cups in the holders you can't reach the controls.  All in all a great little car with good pep and super economy: Averaging 28+ mpg in city driving.",

Additionally, I had to purchase new tires within two months of buying the car only 25k on it, and had to fix the driver's side and sunroof's window seals. I did not expect nor anticipate the cost to repair all of the issues, (around $4000). By the time it hit 42K, I had to fix all of these things. I am so over it, and most of these things should not have gone out! Very disappointed in Mini at the exuberant amounts they charge for parts and labor. Not a reliable vehicle at all! :-( ",

It takes a while before the GIANT speedometer grows on you. But, you will get over it. It is basically a 4 cyl BMW 3 series. If reliability is not an issue over the years, then it is a great car by all means. The HK audio has too much base. It is tight inside but cozy and snug. ",

It had way more than enough power in the Col. mts, yet good fuel economy (36 hwy, 26 city). I had 2 adults with about 4 duffel bags, all of which stowed nicely in the rear. The car is quick, amazingly fun to drive, looks cool and is  comfortable. Negatives are small cup holders , but way better than the past. Controls are switches like a plane but I like that.

Achieved 29.5 mpg on the first tank, in mixed city/highway driving (a good bit of idling in traffic), and the current tank is at 36 mpg for highway and some errands. Great power, even though I'm still breaking it in, and the steering is immediate. Good steering feel, too, the car magazines are wrong on that count. Great stereo (Harmon Kardon/Sirius XM), and very comfortable driving position (I'm 6'1\", 230lbs.). I'm going to keep my Lexus LS, but probably drive this a whole lot more.",

The acceleration is also delayed which makes it tough to get used to. My real problem with the car is the dumb design that BMW put into this car. I've owned the car for about 3 years and never had a problem other than brakes which are weak but who needs them it is a go-kart after all. \nSo it sat a lot during the winter which was quite mild. We found about 2 inches of water in the passenger side floor. I evacuated all the water and dried it out. My wife had left the door ajar so I assumed this was the problem. It happened again a few days later. Turns out the sunroof drain came off during the winter while the car was sitting and the water leaked down the front pillar into the electrical junction box and into the passenger compartment. HI BMW a third grader could have figured this out. Audi had already lost millions in a class action for the same thing. \nSo my junction box is all corroded and it's $2300 to fix it. 9 percent of the original sticker to replace a fuse box that some idiot approved as okay to place it under a roof drain that doesn't even have a clamp to hold it on. GENIUS! FYI the drivers side is set up the same way. I also noticed that the screw covers had all been removed prior so the problem obviously had happened before. \nThe dealer offered me 5k for my 11k car so I'm fixing it and trading it.

High-speed driving is effortless, as the engine creates good mid-range torque. Wind does not affect handling or power.  Interior comfort is very good, too. The car draws good comments and everyone that rides in it finds that it is more than it appears, as in power, comfort, features, quality, etc.",

That being said the rest of the car is a bit disappointing . The car has an auto and regular 1.6 L - this is a sluggish combo. The 17\" wheels look fantastic but after a few months of driving with the run-flats made we want to trade the car in. Switched to high performance regular tires and problem was solved. Overall the car is a ten in appearance and interior design. The performance is solid six. The 4spd auto just doesn't translate well with normally aspirated 1.6. I would advise buying the extended maintenance plan because the cost of repairs can be high if you are unaccustomed to german car repair costs.",

I looked at other cars such as a Civic, Hyundai Elantra, and Kia Optima and they would not discount their cars nearly as much. For the price I paid the car is a great value. It is a premium car. Come standard with 2 zone climate control, blue tooth, sirius radio, alloy wheels, premium vinyl soft touch materials. I get and average of 38 mpg on a tank with 70% high way driving and 30% city driving. I took a 1700 mile trip and averaged 42 mpg for the trip. On the 1700 mile drive, the seats were very comfortable. Much more so than our Dodge Grand Caravan or the Chrysler 300 premium I recently rented. The bluetooth is very easy to setup and the call sound quality is much better than the VW CC I had prior. The only complaint is the knob control for the radio, bluetooth, etc. is not super intuitive and  takes a little to learn it. Once I learned it, it is great, but my wife, who rarely drives it, is struggling to learn it. The Chrysler 300's interface is outstanding. I am 6'4\" and 300+ pounds an the car is very comfortable, more so than the VW CC or the Chrysler 300. The car is pretty quiet on the road. I feel, for the $21,500 I paid for it, it is a premium small car, unique and a great value. I change cars every 18 months (just cause I want too) and this is already one of my favorites.",

The Countryman S is roomy for four people; it's fast; really fast in curves; super in town because of its agility and size ( for maneuvering and parking).   I've had no reliability issues with either of my Minis that I have owned, but my Clubman got better gas mileage ( 28 city and 37 hwy).  The ride on both is rough, so not so good for passengers, especially in city streets in West Virginia where I live. However, this is a sports car and as such, the ride is to be expected.  The interior layout of controls is not good, but , has been corrected in 2014 and later models. Still, I like all Minis.",

But i must confess i later fell in love with the car. Rule of thumb, is to wait a few years to buy the model you like so all the dumb [non-permissible content removed] is taken care of and the constant 2 hour trips to the dealer are about non existant. The only problem i had was an oil sending unit. Was under warranty, and i dislike the plastic trim in and out. But i will take care of that soon.  I immediately removed the run flats,  bought a spare rim. I looked up potential problems and bought all the parts i need just in case,  and have videos of installation process. But i never had to replace a thing yet myself. I changed my oil every 4.5 k. About to do tranny fluid. Even though the car drives perfect.  I replaced all suspension parts for heavy duty ones, by choice, because i was bored, And aliment is rock solid. I lifted my mini so i may have higher clearence and threw lt tires on it. This is year two of ownership , and i have already put 30k on top of the 40k i got it with. And i beat the snot out of it. So im sorry, but im happy with the car, and its reliable.",

The use of RFTs was a business decision; w/o RFTs BMW would have to pay someone to come out and put on your spare as a part of Road Side Assistance.

It is an all around great car to drive, and even is ok for long trips.  My issue is that both the alternator and fuel pump have needed replacing on my car. This is the first car I have owned that needed this.  These are very expensive, look out wallet!  What they also do not tell you is that the spark plugs need to be replaced periodically and will cause the car to literally not run if your dealer overlooks this.  I have never experienced this with other vehicles.  I do not mind that it needs premium fuel to operate, but I do mind the costs of repairs.  If you get this car, make sure you have also bought the extended warranty for the maintenance & tire repairs.  Very expensive option, if you do NOT get this.",

Fun to drive, but EXPENSIVE and CONSTANT maintenance. Computer is quirky. If the car goes into \"limp mode\". The Transmission is sealed and can only be maintained by the \"dealer\" which ask for leg and arm to service. Chronic alignment issues on the \"rear\"? Computer updates that some how get \"missed\" during service but are found after warranty has expired.Continued issues with random warning lights. Low tire is always on and can't get it off not matter how diligent you are with tire pressure. No spare tire which is fun to find out when you have a FLAT. $35K for a car no spare tire?? It is slipper in snow and ice with teh ALL4. Better all wheel drive vehicles. They make this car almost impossible to service yourself. Better cars for the price UPDATE_ Mini North American is aware of the alignment issues. I have eaten through tires about every 3-5 months. I align and it stays that way for about month and it is back out. The last time I contacted Mini North American. Made them aware of the \"short\" rear control arms. They just glazed over it and said we'll make a note of it. The next time you are out look at the rear camber on a mini. TOE IN",

The thermostat was out, re-placed.\nThird issue, at 14K miles, the car would not start. Had it towed to dealer. \"DME error?\" The car is still in the shop day 8. Said the \"main communication circuit board\" is bad, they think? Took 5 days to arrive from Europe. Still not sure if a new circuit board has fixed it, more to follow.

The difference is the Mini is higher off the ground and has all wheel drive.\n\nFor a 4-door Mini sports car - the inside is actually quite roomy.\nMy last car was a VW Touareg and my son says the rear of the Countryman is more comfortable than the Touareg.

Had to wait a month since the part was not avaiable and they had to get it from Europe. They finally got it fixed and the car was working great till I ran out of gas again! They replaced the fuel pump again and also the water pump. They say that they are working out the kinks on this new model but give me a break. Shouldn't they do that before they start selling to the consumers? Can't wait to get rid of it",

Deeper armrest - it won't even hold a CD, move parking brake and then cupholders further back. Put window controls on the doors and improve door armrest location. Lose the center rail - it causes rattles and is way too cute to be functional. Put in a navi system that is worth what it costs. Hint: Garmin does it right - why try to reinvent the best? Take responsibility for gaffes - like cupholders, weak AC, overpriced Navi, no spare or place for one and on and on. There is no excuse for not improving this vehicle. If BMW did, wow - it would be SO much better!",

This car looks SO cool and drives great except for the harshness of the runflat tires. No spare tire and no place for one. No back up camera. Cupholders placement and size are a joke and the whole rail system is silly and causes rattles. Get the three across back seat and avoid the rear rail at least. AC could be better. Navi and almost everything about the interior is pointless in that you need to take a class to learn how everything works and everything is placed where it shouldn't be. A whole lot of counter intuitive design. ",

We've only had it for about two months, and it's amazing how many people have asked about the car when we pull into a parking lot. Everyone thinks it's really a neat car.

I had a Mini Cooper Coupe in 2008, excellent little car, but too small.\r\nThe first problem, my 2008 gave me 500 miles to a full tank, this one 380 miles.  I asked the dealer, he said to drive it for more than 10,000 so the engine can open up and this would change. Not.\r\nThe second problem, every bump on the road could be felt.  I bought more expensive tires, no improvement.\r\nThird, it stalls when you initial a drive after a full stop. I use the \"Sports\" button, this works, but its stays revved, scary to stop.\r\nFourth, windows gets extremely foggy when heat is on.\r\nI am returning this car, even if it kills my credit, not my pocket.

A couple of minor problems in 3 years were quickly taken care of by Mini under warranty.  Have used on long and short trips and around town driving, and found to be very comfortable overall.  Only complaint is \"jumpy\" when hitting bumps in roadway....might be due to hardness of ride in Run Flat Tires ?  We have owned in the past, BMW X-5, Porsche Cayenne, Lexus RX300 and have not found the Mini to be any more unreliable or costly to operate.  We will probably buy another All4 in 2-3 years.",

Now the front wheel makes a spring noise every so often and it scrapes but then stops.  Mini says there's nothing wrong but will offer me a fraction of the purchase price to put me into a new POS Mini.  For now it's in storage because it's too delicate to actually drive.",

Something went wrong when they designed it and even MINI mechanic told me that BMW parts aren't great. It's an awesome car but so not reliable. So far...the wheel bearings went, clutch, fly wheel, fuel pump and spark plugs. My car has 43k miles and none of this really should be happening. Did I get a lemon? Not sure...MINI seems to blame quality of parts. Some things were recalled...just been frustrating. When a MINI mechanic tells you this is typical...you know something is up.

                    "text": "I love Mini's. I have had 5, two currently. I traded a Clubman S to get this Countryman SALL4. I wanted a little more ground clearance for snow and taking kayaks to the rivers and lakes. I wanted to keep a low throw to the roof because I have to put one or two 45lb kayaks up there. The Countryman had virtually all the right characteristics with AWD, low roof, good clearance and four doors for guests. \n\nThe car drives great and is very comfortable. I just got vinyl seats because of wet clothes from snow and kayaking. They are surprisingly comfortable and nearly perfect for me. Vision is great, driving is solid and sporty and close to regular Mini's. It has a bit more of a big-car feel at about 3300lb but that's not bad. \n\nHere is the significant negative. I just got it back from the shop this week with a new engine at 14200 miles. I have low mileage because I have three cars. one of which is a company-work car. I went in for an oil change and the rear main seal was leaking. They called it \"crank lock\" and I did not go over it in detail with the technician ,although I wanted to. I am fascinated by engineering. \n\nIn any case the dealership was fantastic. They were courteous and kept me up to speed on the pace of the repairs. I asked if it was a common problem or manufacturer defect and they said it did not seem so. However, I see another review here by another guy who had an engine replaced at low mileage, too. I smell a recall in the future. \n\nSo, here's the summary. Mini's are fun, sporty, urban-cool and urban-practical to the max. They drive well and do everything just as I would hope. However, they are hit or miss, with a lot of misses on reliability. Understand, I love Mini's. I am in a Mini Cooper club but I have to be straight on the reviews because I use these reviews extensively myself. \n\nNot one other thing has gone wrong but the engine is a big deal and I think they said they replaced the water pump at the same time. So, if you consider one of these my best advice is be sure they are under warranty  when you buy.",

This fit the bill and then some.  The sound is good so I won need to replace anything  and I love how the keyless  entry is standard.  It's a joy to drive and my husband and I fight  over the drivers seat. Even my 7 year old thinks mommy has a cool car.

The buy back value is based off of the mileage when you first had it in the shop for the repair.  \nIt's a cute car with some great features, yet it appears they just tried to put too much in a small space.",

After only having the car for 6 months i started having problems starting with my tire pressure monitors. My left tire pressure monitor kept saying that it was low and flat but when i looked at the tire it was fine and the air compressor part said i had fine air pressure. Than my car started having transmission/engine problems at only 8,000 miles as well as my car redlining at 25 mph. My car is now dying when i make sharp left and right hand turns, as well as the car redlining at 25 and finally shifting to a higher gear after i have no choice but to floor it and have the rpms at 8 on the rpm screen on the car than once it finally shift the car knocks you forward with a loud and hard clunking noise. I have had it with this car! Mini and BMW customer relations have been a total pain to deal with saying it hasn't been serviced enough to help me with a problem. NO car should drive like this!! My car is still in the service department currently and the service techs have no idea what is causing the problems or how to fix it saying they feel what I'm talking about but not sure if its a mechanical problem or electronic issue... Its safe to say i will not be recommending this car to anyone not even my worst enemy! if i could give it 0 stars i would.",

                    "text": "I've had this car about a year, standard city driving, with some long highway trips occasionally.  Bought it because I wanted something good for city driving and parking, and carting around a couple kids, but also with a little style and oomph. The model I have is pretty loaded, with the GPS system, leather interior, fancy sound system etc.\n\nAfter a year, pretty disappointed.  It super cute and fairly fun to drive, though a little stiff.  However the navigation system is so counterintuitive that I literally never use it- weird menus, no touch screen, takes forever to input addresses etc.  The sound system interface is similarly unwieldy, the sound is great, but it is much more complicated than it should be to save radio stations, seek channels, switch inputs etc.  All first world problems, admittedly, but it does diminish your enjoyment of the car when it feels designed by people who were trying to drive you crazy.  Similarly, it lacks basic conveniences for the price point, like a back up camera.  Even the fact that it doesn't have a simple clock on the dashboard (you have to toggle three buttons to see the time) is annoying.\n\nThe worst part of the car is the gas mileage.  With such a little car, you'd think it would be great. Manufacturer says it should be about 25 city, 32 highway.  Hah!  On the back of a tow truck, maybe.  I put only premium unleaded gas in (never had to do that with another car) and still only get about 17 mpg with normal city driving, maybe 23 on the highway. When I took it in to be checked, they said there was nothing they could do, and that they had had a number of people with similar complaints.  \n\nOverall, though I like the style and fun, I would not recommend.  And will probably be trading mine in pretty soon.",

I wanted something big enough to carry my drums around so the Countryman seemed like a good balance of performance and practicality. I've had sporty cars before but I've been very happy with the Countryman. That's not to say there isn't any room for improvement. The visibility out of the back isn't great and one of the first things I did I was add a backup camera. Love it... It should be standard equipment on all modern cars. I've put about 14,000 miles on it so far and hasn't been in the shop for anything. The ride is ok with the Countryman but hitting a pothole or rut in the road will rattle your teeth. I know any performance vehicles ride is similar and I'll probably not go with the run flat tires when the time comes to replace them. The instrumentation isn't intuitive and takes a while to figure out, but wasn't a deal breaker for me. It provides info on every part of the car and will let you know if something isn't shut,tire pressure low, gas getting low and how far you can go with the gas you have, it even will let you know when the car needs regular servicing. \n      I've had the mini now for about 2 years. The car has been my daily driver and has been dependable. The only problem that came up is the sensors on the wheels came on for the right front tire to inform me that the tire pressure was low. I'm still using the run flat tires that came with the car and the ride is still very rough when driving a bumpy road. Still have plenty of rubber left on tires but going to put on regular performance tires in a few more months.\nUpdate\nStill problem free. Only in the shop for scheduled maintenance. The rubber on the run flats still good so I'm putting off replacing those for a while longer. Car starts right up every time I push the ignition button and runs smoothly.",

Takes corners very well.  Gas mileage is pretty decent as long as you don't speed too much.  Still small enough to make parking easy.   \n\nI am concerned about its longevity.  My windshield is already pretty pitted up after having the car for a little over a year.  The windshield angle is steep, so it will catch and not deflect road pebbles.  Electric gremlins are already showing up - the door ajar warning light kept coming on while on the highway, even though all doors were shut tight.  Happened on a few occasions.  Some rattling starting to show up near the driver seat, can't tell if it's coming from the seat itself or somewhere else.  Sometimes the idling will dip drastically and takes a few moments for the ECU to regulate the idle.  Seats will cause butt and back aches on road trips.  Center speedometer looks cool at first but the novelty wears off quickly.  \n\nI will likely not purchase this car after the lease is up.  It's a fun car to have as long as you have a warranty and you're not going to be doing long road trips.",

The sport suspension ride was so stiff on the stock run flat tires that I bought a set of regular tires for it within a week. Doing so improved the ride, but I owned the car for 45 days before I couldn't live with it any longer, and I traded the damn thing in on a MUCH better car, the MINI S Clubman ALL4, and I LOVE the car. Before you buy an overpriced Countryman, test drive a Mazda, or a Honda, or a Ford, or, or, or... Do NOT base your opinion of the rest of the MINI lineup on the Countryman. MINIs are a hoot to drive. Just not THIS MINI.",

I was told I would get 30 MPG and the closet I have gotten is 27. Sadly enough I just drove from Covina to Santa Clarita and I got 24 MPG on a 100 mile turn around. What a shame and it is sad because this was one of the most important values for me besides performance and comfort.  Nothing good to say about this car. [contact info removed]",

Turned in the lease on the Highlander and opted for this little bad boy!  Just packed it full of gear and put the Thule on the top and headed for the lake for the week...4 adults, gear and the full Thule at about 70mph and I averaged 26mpg.   I thought that was pretty good for a motor that hadn't even been broken in yet!?!  All 4 adults were comfortable and had no complaints on the 3.5 hour drive.   Harmon Kardon sounds insane good!  We have a little Audi with the BnO and this is not quite the same quality of sound...but damn near!  Bluetooth works well and phone calls are audible.   The power for a little 1.6 liter Turbo is surprisingly good!  Having other cars that are quite quick, I found myself not disappointed with this at all.",

The Laguna Green color I have was not in production for long so having a rare color is kind of fun. The MINI Connected system works pretty well even without an iPhone you get a fair amount of functionality and the center screen is very nice. The Bluetooth audio streaming works well with my the phones I've tried it with. The USB input also works well if you put mp3s onto a memory stick. My car has the HK sound system which sounds very good.\n\nWhat I've loved best about this car is parking it in the city. I've squeezed it into some really tiny spots on the street. The handling is great as well and the steering feel is strong. Even the base Cooper Coupe has plenty of power for a normal driver. I've never had any issue with respect to accelerating when necessary. \n\nThe boot is fairly large for a MINI and there are some interesting little storage areas as well.  \n\nThe ride can be a little harsh on rough roads given the small wheelbase, but on good roads the ride quality is quite nice. The sport seats are very comfortable and supportive.",

                    "text": "I got my JCW Coupe for track work. So far I have done only one autocross and no track days. I got the automatic because I wanted the paddle shifters for great up and downshifts. It takes some practice but the shifts are amazing. Let me do the negatives first. First, with the automatic there is a bad peddle lag. Even if you put it in sport mode it is an automatic. It was terrible at autocross. With more practice, I could handle it but for autocross the manual is the way to go. I think the peddle settings are no different than a standard Mini. Also, the JCW does not come with a sport suspension standard even if you thought you were buying the \"M\" or \"AMG\" of Mini's. You need to add that and it can cost a good bit. So, it is not 100% sport. \n\nThe rest is all great. Acceleration once you start is excellent, handling is excellent and the standard suspension is great for comfort if you want a daily driver. If you put a sport suspension and oversized wheels it is very very hard. You can buy the JCW suspension for $4k more and it might be the best all purpose suspension. Vision is limited but frankly I expect that is a sportscar or convertible. The styling is so unique many people will point and ask you about it. It is perhaps my favorite thing about the car. It looks aggressive, yet friendly. The trunk is to die for in a two-seater. The reason is that the back seats of a regular Mini have been removed and even though the roof is lowered you have a ton of trunk for a little car. It has a reach through that is handy for longer stuff or reaching back to say a small cooler. It is a great road trip car and can handle decent luggage for two people. The car will fly and corner well and to me your big decisions are three if you are looking at one. 1. Automatic or manual. 2. Tech or minimal tech (adds cost). 3. Suspension, stiffer or softer or premium sport. If you max everything out this car will be in the mid $40s, new. Mini stopped making this model so you will have to be on the used car market. I actually like that as it keeps the car an uncommon model amongst and uncommon car. I like unique. Just drive one and see what you think. All of the coupe and roadsters are great but I think the base model sort of misses out with the low power. It is the sportiest of the lineup and also the smallest of the Mini's.",

One of the best things is the trunk. With the rear seats of a regular MINI removed you get an amazing amount of room. Two people with modest to light duffle bag type luggage will have no problem. Compare to any car of similar size like a Miata. The gas mileage is amazing for a peppy sporty car. I got over 40mpg at times in the mountains and pretty much mid to high 30's going to Vegas. Next, the sound system rocks and they finally got much better at sound proofing the Mini, too, although it is not lux sedan quiet. ",

Huge trunk, 33-35 mpg and good on insurance. It is not easy to get in and it rides like a sports car because it is one. This is exactly what I was looking for and it does not disappoint. The controls are quirky and I actually prefer them now. Great rare car. It should only come in the \"S\" and JCW models and the 6 speed manual only.\n\nUpdate: Still loving the car.  Turns heads, pulled over 1.3g on an on-ramp.  Absolutely love the car.",

The stereo system is okay, and it comes with aux/iPod support. The only downside of this is that the proprietary MINI aux/usb adapter is like $85 to buy, and it's basically a cable that combines a USB charger and the aux cable into 1 unified cable - huge ripoff. \n - Sunroof is awesome \n - Trunk space is better than expected\n\nCons: \n - Gas mileage is extremely deceiving. The advertised MPG is something like 26 / 35. Ha! More like 17 / 23. I suppose most car companies slightly inflate their MPG numbers, but come on MINI.... \n - Electronics suck pt 1: In hindsight, I should've paid for the premium electronics package - the standard is god awful. There is only 1 knob that controls the entire \"console\" - which is extremely minimal in features. Besides radio, it only has temperature, time, and MPG.. \n - Electronics suck pt 2: For my MINI, I've had a bunch of small issues with the primary computer of the car. (1) The \"miles remaining\" number is wildly inaccurate. Within 2 minutes of normal city driving, the expected miles remaining dropped from 26 to 0, and then from 0 - 4. (2) The tire pressure lights are constant red-herrings.\n\nOverall: fun car to drive on the highways and on open roads. Gas mileage is pretty crappy, and the electronics are really poor quality.",

Since buying the car my son has taken an interest in driving he did not have before. It has proven very reliable and is everything I want and need in a vehicle.

The wind deflector is designed to fold in half to allow you to more easily reach the top to lift it. Depending on your height you may be better off jumping out of the car to lift the top up. I suspect most drivers could drop the top while seated. Putting the top down does not change the luggage space. It's remarkably well designed when folded and the top creates it's own tonneau cover.",

I agree with the Edmunds review in that with the top up there is still a bit of noise and limited visibility, however, why would you want to drive this car with the top up? If it's raining outside I leave it in the garage. Otherwise, it's top down fun and exhilaration! The 6 speed manual is perfect for just that. I find it a struggle to not double the speed limit on most roads. In 3rd gear I can go as slow as 16 mph or as fast as 60. Almost like having an automatic. Ride can be rough at times but, hello, it's a sports car. Want a cushy ride? Buy a caddy! If you want pure driving fun with some awesome features, this is the car for you.",

Mini's entertainment system drives me crazy. I still think its a fun car but best as a luxury, not a daily driver.\nOriginal review:\nI have owned my Roadster for slightly more than 2 years now. This is, without a doubt, the most fun car I will likely own. On a veautiful day or a balmy night, I think it is unrivaled. The multiple options offered are terrific, the car has been reliable and it is an incredibly fun drive. There are some cons... Backing up with the top up is a gamble at best, there are times I cannot see. The ride is rough, bumpy and loud. The Mini tech center could use a lot of work. For instance your phone is on Bluetooth audio but you want to charge your phine so you plug it in, now the next time you want to use Bluetooth audio you have to go through a maze of menus to re-select Bluetooth for music playback. That's silly. Would I buy it again? If it was my second car, in a heartbeat but as my daily driver as it is now, likely no.",

The peppy engine with its well respectable gas consumption is awesome, not mentioning how responsive and smooth it is as well.\nThe sport mode is really worse it as you can have fun on the weekends and still consume less the rest of the time. Our \"MINI Yours\" interior really makes it special and unique. There's a surprising amount of storage for its size. You'll never feel cramped (we tried the Mazda Miata. That would have been a nightmare for the passenger). And lastly it's a car you can get with a real color!!!",
